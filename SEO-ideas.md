Content Enhancement:

-  Add brief author bios on writer pages to provide more content
   value
-  Consider adding publication dates and historical context for
   novels
-  Add reading time estimates for chapters

Technical SEO:

-  Consider adding hreflang if you plan international versions
-  Add theme-color meta tag for mobile browsers
-  Consider preloading critical fonts if using custom fonts

Performance:

-  Your images appear optimized, but consider WebP format
-  Implement lazy loading for novel/chapter lists if they get
   large

Content Strategy:

-  Blog posts about classic literature could drive additional
   organic traffic
-  Reading guides or discussion questions for novels
-  "Similar books" recommendations to increase internal linking
