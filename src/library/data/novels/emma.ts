			'Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy\ndisposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had\nlived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex\nher.',
			'She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate, indulgent\nfather; and had, in consequence of her sister’s marriage, been mistress\nof his house from a very early period. Her mother had died too long ago for her\nto have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses; and her place had\nbeen supplied by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short\nof a mother in affection.',
			'Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse’s family, less as a\ngoverness than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly of Emma.\nBetween them it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before Miss\nTaylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the mildness of her\ntemper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of\nauthority being now long passed away, they had been living together as friend\nand friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked; highly\nesteeming Miss Taylor’s judgment, but directed chiefly by her own.',
			'The real evils, indeed, of Emma’s situation were the power of having\nrather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of\nherself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many\nenjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so unperceived, that they did\nnot by any means rank as misfortunes with her.',
			'Sorrow came—a gentle sorrow—but not at all in the shape of any\ndisagreeable consciousness.—Miss Taylor married. It was Miss\nTaylor’s loss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of\nthis beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance.\nThe wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father and herself were left\nto dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening. Her\nfather composed himself to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only\nto sit and think of what she had lost.',
			'The event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston was a man\nof unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and pleasant manners;\nand there was some satisfaction in considering with what self-denying, generous\nfriendship she had always wished and promoted the match; but it was a black\nmorning’s work for her. The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour\nof every day. She recalled her past kindness—the kindness, the affection\nof sixteen years—how she had taught and how she had played with her from\nfive years old—how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her\nin health—and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood.\nA large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven\nyears, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed\nIsabella’s marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a dearer,\ntenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such as few\npossessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of\nthe family, interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in\nherself, in every pleasure, every scheme of hers—one to whom she could\nspeak every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her as could\nnever find fault.',
			'How was she to bear the change?—It was true that her friend was going\nonly half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the\ndifference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a Miss Taylor\nin the house; and with all her advantages, natural and domestic, she was now in\ngreat danger of suffering from intellectual solitude. She dearly loved her\nfather, but he was no companion for her. He could not meet her in conversation,\nrational or playful.',
			'The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had not\nmarried early) was much increased by his constitution and habits; for having\nbeen a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mind or body, he was a\nmuch older man in ways than in years; and though everywhere beloved for the\nfriendliness of his heart and his amiable temper, his talents could not have\nrecommended him at any time.',
			'Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being settled\nin London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily reach; and many a\nlong October and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield,\nbefore Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her husband, and\ntheir little children, to fill the house, and give her pleasant society again.',
			'Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town, to which\nHartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and name, did really\nbelong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses were first in consequence there.\nAll looked up to them. She had many acquaintance in the place, for her father\nwas universally civil, but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of\nMiss Taylor for even half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not\nbut sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke, and\nmade it necessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He was a\nnervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was used to, and\nhating to part with them; hating change of every kind. Matrimony, as the origin\nof change, was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled to\nhis own daughter’s marrying, nor could ever speak of her but with\ncompassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection, when he was now\nobliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his habits of gentle\nselfishness, and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel\ndifferently from himself, he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had\ndone as sad a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal\nhappier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and\nchatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but when\ntea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at\ndinner,',
			'“Poor Miss Taylor!—I wish she were here again. What a pity it is\nthat Mr. Weston ever thought of her!”',
			'“I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such a\ngood-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a good\nwife;—and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever, and\nbear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her own?”',
			'“A house of her own!—But where is the advantage of a house of her\nown? This is three times as large.—And you have never any odd humours, my\ndear.”',
			'“How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see\nus!—We shall be always meeting! We must begin; we must go and pay\nwedding visit very soon.”',
			'“My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could\nnot walk half so far.”',
			'“No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage, to\nbe sure.”',
			'“The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a\nlittle way;—and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our\nvisit?”',
			'“They are to be put into Mr. Weston’s stable, papa. You know we\nhave settled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last\nnight. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going to\nRandalls, because of his daughter’s being housemaid there. I only doubt\nwhether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing, papa. You got\nHannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned\nher—James is so obliged to you!”',
			'“I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would not\nhave had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am sure she\nwill make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken girl; I have a\ngreat opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always curtseys and asks me how I\ndo, in a very pretty manner; and when you have had her here to do needlework, I\nobserve she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it.\nI am sure she will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to\npoor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see. Whenever\nJames goes over to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us. He\nwill be able to tell her how we all are.”',
			'Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and hoped, by\nthe help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably through the evening, and be\nattacked by no regrets but her own. The backgammon-table was placed; but a\nvisitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary.',
			'Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not only a\nvery old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly connected with it,\nas the elder brother of Isabella’s husband. He lived about a mile from\nHighbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome, and at this time more\nwelcome than usual, as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London.\nHe had returned to a late dinner, after some days’ absence, and now\nwalked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square. It was a\nhappy circumstance, and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had\na cheerful manner, which always did him good; and his many inquiries after\n“poor Isabella” and her children were answered most satisfactorily.\nWhen this was over, Mr. Woodhouse gratefully observed, “It is very kind\nof you, Mr. Knightley, to come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am\nafraid you must have had a shocking walk.”',
			'“Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I\nmust draw back from your great fire.”',
			'“But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not catch\ncold.”',
			'“Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.”',
			'“Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain\nhere. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast. I\nwanted them to put off the wedding.”',
			'“By the bye—I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of\nwhat sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my\ncongratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you all\nbehave? Who cried most?”',
			'“Ah! poor Miss Taylor! ’Tis a sad business.”',
			'“Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say\n‘poor Miss Taylor.’ I have a great regard for you and Emma; but\nwhen it comes to the question of dependence or independence!—At any rate,\nit must be better to have only one to please than two.”',
			'“Especially when one of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome\ncreature!” said Emma playfully. “That is what you have in your\nhead, I know—and what you would certainly say if my father were not\nby.”',
			'“I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,” said Mr. Woodhouse,\nwith a sigh. “I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and\ntroublesome.”',
			'“My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean you, or suppose\nMr. Knightley to mean you. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only\nmyself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know—in a\njoke—it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another.”',
			'Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma\nWoodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and though this was not\nparticularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew it would be so much less so to\nher father, that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as\nher not being thought perfect by every body.',
			'“Emma knows I never flatter her,” said Mr. Knightley, “but I\nmeant no reflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons\nto please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be a\ngainer.”',
			'“Well,” said Emma, willing to let it pass—“you want to\nhear about the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved\ncharmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks: not a\ntear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that we were going\nto be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting every day.”',
			'“Dear Emma bears every thing so well,” said her father. “But,\nMr. Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am sure\nshe will miss her more than she thinks for.”',
			'Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. “It is\nimpossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,” said Mr.\nKnightley. “We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could\nsuppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor’s\nadvantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor’s\ntime of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to her to\nbe secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow herself to\nfeel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have\nher so happily married.”',
			'“And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,” said Emma,\n“and a very considerable one—that I made the match myself. I made\nthe match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved\nin the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may\ncomfort me for any thing.”',
			'Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, “Ah! my\ndear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for whatever you\nsay always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more matches.”',
			'“I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for\nother people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such\nsuccess, you know!—Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry\nagain. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who seemed\nso perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied either in his\nbusiness in town or among his friends here, always acceptable wherever he went,\nalways cheerful—Mr. Weston need not spend a single evening in the year\nalone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr. Weston certainly would never marry\nagain. Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed, and\nothers of the son and the uncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense\nwas talked on the subject, but I believed none of it.',
			'“Ever since the day—about four years ago—that Miss Taylor and\nI met with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted\naway with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer\nMitchell’s, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the match from\nthat hour; and when such success has blessed me in this instance, dear papa,\nyou cannot think that I shall leave off match-making.”',
			'“I do not understand what you mean by ‘success,’” said\nMr. Knightley. “Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly\nand delicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to\nbring about this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady’s mind!\nBut if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means\nonly your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, ‘I think it\nwould be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry\nher,’ and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why\ndo you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are you proud of? You made a\nlucky guess; and that is all that can be said.”',
			'“And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky\nguess?—I pity you.—I thought you cleverer—for, depend upon it\na lucky guess is never merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as\nto my poor word ‘success,’ which you quarrel with, I do not know\nthat I am so entirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty\npictures; but I think there may be a third—a something between the\ndo-nothing and the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston’s visits\nhere, and given many little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters,\nit might not have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield\nenough to comprehend that.”',
			'“A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,\nunaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their own\nconcerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than good to them,\nby interference.”',
			'“Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,”\nrejoined Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. “But, my dear, pray do\nnot make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one’s\nfamily circle grievously.”',
			'“Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr.\nElton, papa,—I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody in\nHighbury who deserves him—and he has been here a whole year, and has\nfitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have him single\nany longer—and I thought when he was joining their hands to-day, he\nlooked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for\nhim! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I have of doing\nhim a service.”',
			'“Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good young\nman, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shew him any\nattention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day. That will be a\nmuch better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet\nhim.”',
			'“With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,” said Mr.\nKnightley, laughing, “and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a\nmuch better thing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the\nfish and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, a\nman of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.”',

			'Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family, which\nfor the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and\nproperty. He had received a good education, but, on succeeding early in life to\na small independence, had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits\nin which his brothers were engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind\nand social temper by entering into the militia of his county, then embodied.',
			'Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his military\nlife had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great Yorkshire family, and\nMiss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was surprized, except her brother\nand his wife, who had never seen him, and who were full of pride and\nimportance, which the connexion would offend.',
			'Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her\nfortune—though her fortune bore no proportion to the\nfamily-estate—was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took\nplace, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her\noff with due decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce much\nhappiness. Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she had a husband\nwhose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in\nreturn for the great goodness of being in love with him; but though she had one\nsort of spirit, she had not the best. She had resolution enough to pursue her\nown will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain from unreasonable\nregrets at that brother’s unreasonable anger, nor from missing the\nluxuries of her former home. They lived beyond their income, but still it was\nnothing in comparison of Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but\nshe wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of\nEnscombe.',
			'Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills, as\nmaking such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of the bargain;\nfor when his wife died, after a three years’ marriage, he was rather a\npoorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain. From the expense of the\nchild, however, he was soon relieved. The boy had, with the additional\nsoftening claim of a lingering illness of his mother’s, been the means of\na sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, having no children of\ntheir own, nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for, offered\nto take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease. Some\nscruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt;\nbut as they were overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to\nthe care and the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort to\nseek, and his own situation to improve as he could.',
			'A complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the militia and engaged\nin trade, having brothers already established in a good way in London, which\nafforded him a favourable opening. It was a concern which brought just\nemployment enough. He had still a small house in Highbury, where most of his\nleisure days were spent; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of\nsociety, the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away.\nHe had, by that time, realised an easy competence—enough to secure the\npurchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed\nfor—enough to marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to\nlive according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition.',
			'It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes; but\nas it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, it had not shaken his\ndetermination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls, and the sale\nof Randalls was long looked forward to; but he had gone steadily on, with these\nobjects in view, till they were accomplished. He had made his fortune, bought\nhis house, and obtained his wife; and was beginning a new period of existence,\nwith every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through. He\nhad never been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that, even\nin his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful a\nwell-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the\npleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen,\nto excite gratitude than to feel it.',
			'He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own; for as to\nFrank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle’s heir, it\nhad become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of Churchill on\ncoming of age. It was most unlikely, therefore, that he should ever want his\nfather’s assistance. His father had no apprehension of it. The aunt was a\ncapricious woman, and governed her husband entirely; but it was not in Mr.\nWeston’s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to\naffect one so dear, and, as he believed, so deservedly dear. He saw his son\nevery year in London, and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a\nvery fine young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too. He was\nlooked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and\nprospects a kind of common concern.',
			'Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively curiosity\nto see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little returned that he had\nnever been there in his life. His coming to visit his father had been often\ntalked of but never achieved.',
			'Now, upon his father’s marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a\nmost proper attention, that the visit should take place. There was not a\ndissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs.\nand Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit. Now was the\ntime for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when\nit was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion. For a\nfew days, every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the handsome\nletter Mrs. Weston had received. “I suppose you have heard of the\nhandsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written to Mrs. Weston? I understand it\nwas a very handsome letter, indeed. Mr. Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse\nsaw the letter, and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his\nlife.”',
			'It was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of course, formed a\nvery favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing attention was an\nirresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most welcome addition to\nevery source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had\nalready secured. She felt herself a most fortunate woman; and she had lived\nlong enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought, where the only\nregret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had\nnever cooled, and who could ill bear to part with her.',
			'She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, without pain,\nof Emma’s losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour’s ennui,\nfrom the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble\ncharacter; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been,\nand had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well\nand happily through its little difficulties and privations. And then there was\nsuch comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield, so\nconvenient for even solitary female walking, and in Mr. Weston’s\ndisposition and circumstances, which would make the approaching season no\nhindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together.',
			'Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs. Weston,\nand of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction—her more than\nsatisfaction—her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent, that\nEmma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize at his being\nstill able to pity ‘poor Miss Taylor,’ when they left her at\nRandalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away in the\nevening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own. But never\ndid she go without Mr. Woodhouse’s giving a gentle sigh, and saying,\n“Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay.”',
			'There was no recovering Miss Taylor—nor much likelihood of ceasing to\npity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse. The\ncompliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by being\nwished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which had been a\ngreat distress to him, was all eat up. His own stomach could bear nothing rich,\nand he could never believe other people to be different from himself. What was\nunwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body; and he had, therefore,\nearnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding-cake at all, and when\nthat proved vain, as earnestly tried to prevent any body’s eating it. He\nhad been at the pains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject.\nMr. Perry was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one\nof the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse’s life; and upon being applied to, he\ncould not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias of\ninclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with many—perhaps\nwith most people, unless taken moderately. With such an opinion, in\nconfirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the\nnewly married pair; but still the cake was eaten; and there was no rest for his\nbenevolent nerves till it was all gone.',
			'There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with\na slice of Mrs. Weston’s wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr. Woodhouse\nwould never believe it.',
		],
		[
			'Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. He liked very much to have\nhis friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from his long\nresidence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune, his house, and\nhis daughter, he could command the visits of his own little circle, in a great\nmeasure, as he liked. He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that\ncircle; his horror of late hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for\nany acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms. Fortunately for\nhim, Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in the\nparish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many such. Not\nunfrequently, through Emma’s persuasion, he had some of the chosen and\nthe best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he preferred; and,\nunless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company, there was scarcely an\nevening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card-table for him.',
			'Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and by Mr.\nElton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege of exchanging\nany vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of\nMr. Woodhouse’s drawing-room, and the smiles of his lovely daughter, was\nin no danger of being thrown away.',
			'After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were Mrs.\nand Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost always at the service of\nan invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched and carried home so often,\nthat Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses. Had\nit taken place only once a year, it would have been a grievance.',
			'Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old lady,\nalmost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with her single\ndaughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the regard and\nrespect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward circumstances, can\nexcite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman\nneither young, handsome, rich, nor married. Miss Bates stood in the very worst\npredicament in the world for having much of the public favour; and she had no\nintellectual superiority to make atonement to herself, or frighten those who\nmight hate her into outward respect. She had never boasted either beauty or\ncleverness. Her youth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life\nwas devoted to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small\nincome go as far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, and a woman whom\nno one named without good-will. It was her own universal good-will and\ncontented temper which worked such wonders. She loved every body, was\ninterested in every body’s happiness, quicksighted to every body’s\nmerits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and surrounded with\nblessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good neighbours and friends,\nand a home that wanted for nothing. The simplicity and cheerfulness of her\nnature, her contented and grateful spirit, were a recommendation to every body,\nand a mine of felicity to herself. She was a great talker upon little matters,\nwhich exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmless\ngossip.',
			'Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School—not of a seminary, or an\nestablishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of refined\nnonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality, upon new\nprinciples and new systems—and where young ladies for enormous pay might\nbe screwed out of health and into vanity—but a real, honest,\nold-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments\nwere sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might be sent to be out of the\nway, and scramble themselves into a little education, without any danger of\ncoming back prodigies. Mrs. Goddard’s school was in high repute—and\nvery deservedly; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had\nan ample house and garden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them\nrun about a great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains\nwith her own hands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now\nwalked after her to church. She was a plain, motherly kind of woman, who had\nworked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to the occasional\nholiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to Mr. Woodhouse’s\nkindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour, hung\nround with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win or lose a few sixpences by\nhis fireside.',
			'These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect;\nand happy was she, for her father’s sake, in the power; though, as far as\nshe was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston. She\nwas delighted to see her father look comfortable, and very much pleased with\nherself for contriving things so well; but the quiet prosings of three such\nwomen made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long\nevenings she had fearfully anticipated.',
			'As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the present\nday, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, in most respectful\nterms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her; a most welcome request: for\nMiss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knew very well by sight, and had\nlong felt an interest in, on account of her beauty. A very gracious invitation\nwas returned, and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the\nmansion.',
			'Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had placed her,\nseveral years back, at Mrs. Goddard’s school, and somebody had lately\nraised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour-boarder. This was\nall that was generally known of her history. She had no visible friends but\nwhat had been acquired at Highbury, and was now just returned from a long visit\nin the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her.',
			'She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma\nparticularly admired. She was short, plump, and fair, with a fine bloom, blue\neyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of great sweetness, and, before\nthe end of the evening, Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her\nperson, and quite determined to continue the acquaintance.',
			'She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith’s\nconversation, but she found her altogether very engaging—not\ninconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk—and yet so far from pushing,\nshewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly grateful for\nbeing admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of\nevery thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to, that she must\nhave good sense, and deserve encouragement. Encouragement should be given.\nThose soft blue eyes, and all those natural graces, should not be wasted on the\ninferior society of Highbury and its connexions. The acquaintance she had\nalready formed were unworthy of her. The friends from whom she had just parted,\nthough very good sort of people, must be doing her harm. They were a family of\nthe name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large farm\nof Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell—very creditably,\nshe believed—she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them—but they\nmust be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who\nwanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect.\nShe would notice her; she would improve her; she would detach her from\nher bad acquaintance, and introduce her into good society; she would form her\nopinions and her manners. It would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind\nundertaking; highly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and\npowers.',
			'She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and listening, and\nforming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the evening flew away at a\nvery unusual rate; and the supper-table, which always closed such parties, and\nfor which she had been used to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and\nready, and moved forwards to the fire, before she was aware. With an alacrity\nbeyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the\ncredit of doing every thing well and attentively, with the real good-will of a\nmind delighted with its own ideas, did she then do all the honours of the meal,\nand help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an\nurgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil\nscruples of their guests.',
			'Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse’s feelings were in sad warfare. He\nloved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his youth, but\nhis conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see\nany thing put on it; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors\nto every thing, his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat.',
			'Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could, with\nthorough self-approbation, recommend; though he might constrain himself, while\nthe ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things, to say:',
			'“Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. An egg\nboiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling an egg better\nthan any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else; but you\nneed not be afraid, they are very small, you see—one of our small eggs\nwill not hurt you. Miss Bates, let Emma help you to a little bit of\ntart—a very little bit. Ours are all apple-tarts. You need not be\nafraid of unwholesome preserves here. I do not advise the custard. Mrs.\nGoddard, what say you to half a glass of wine? A small\nhalf-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it could disagree with\nyou.”',
			'Emma allowed her father to talk—but supplied her visitors in a much more\nsatisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular pleasure in\nsending them away happy. The happiness of Miss Smith was quite equal to her\nintentions. Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage in Highbury, that the\nprospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure; but the\nhumble, grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings, delighted\nwith the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening,\nand actually shaken hands with her at last!',

			'Harriet Smith’s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing. Quick and\ndecided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging, and telling\nher to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased, so did their\nsatisfaction in each other. As a walking companion, Emma had very early\nforeseen how useful she might find her. In that respect Mrs. Weston’s\nloss had been important. Her father never went beyond the shrubbery, where two\ndivisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk, or his short, as the\nyear varied; and since Mrs. Weston’s marriage her exercise had been too\nmuch confined. She had ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not\npleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any time\nto a walk, would be a valuable addition to her privileges. But in every\nrespect, as she saw more of her, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her\nkind designs.',
			'Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful\ndisposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be guided by\nany one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herself was very amiable; and\nher inclination for good company, and power of appreciating what was elegant\nand clever, shewed that there was no want of taste, though strength of\nunderstanding must not be expected. Altogether she was quite convinced of\nHarriet Smith’s being exactly the young friend she wanted—exactly\nthe something which her home required. Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of\nthe question. Two such could never be granted. Two such she did not want. It\nwas quite a different sort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs.\nWeston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem.\nHarriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful. For Mrs. Weston\nthere was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.',
			'Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the\nparents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready to tell every thing in her\npower, but on this subject questions were vain. Emma was obliged to fancy what\nshe liked—but she could never believe that in the same situation\nshe should not have discovered the truth. Harriet had no penetration.\nShe had been satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell\nher; and looked no farther.',
			'Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the school in\ngeneral, formed naturally a great part of the conversation—and but for\nher acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the\nwhole. But the Martins occupied her thoughts a good deal; she had spent two\nvery happy months with them, and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her\nvisit, and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged\nher talkativeness—amused by such a picture of another set of beings, and\nenjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of\nMrs. Martin’s having “two parlours, two very good parlours,\nindeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard’s drawing-room; and of\nher having an upper maid who had lived five-and-twenty years with her; and of\ntheir having eight cows, two of them Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a\nvery pretty little Welch cow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin’s saying as she\nwas so fond of it, it should be called her cow; and of their having a\nvery handsome summer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were\nall to drink tea:—a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a\ndozen people.”',
			'For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate cause; but\nas she came to understand the family better, other feelings arose. She had\ntaken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and daughter, a son and\nson’s wife, who all lived together; but when it appeared that the Mr.\nMartin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was always mentioned with\napprobation for his great good-nature in doing something or other, was a single\nman; that there was no young Mrs. Martin, no wife in the case; she did suspect\ndanger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness, and\nthat, if she were not taken care of, she might be required to sink herself\nforever.',
			'With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number and meaning;\nand she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin, and there was\nevidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had\nhad in their moonlight walks and merry evening games; and dwelt a good deal\nupon his being so very good-humoured and obliging. He had gone three miles\nround one day in order to bring her some walnuts, because she had said how fond\nshe was of them, and in every thing else he was so very obliging. He had his\nshepherd’s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her. She\nwas very fond of singing. He could sing a little himself. She believed he was\nvery clever, and understood every thing. He had a very fine flock, and, while\nshe was with them, he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the\ncountry. She believed every body spoke well of him. His mother and sisters were\nvery fond of him. Mrs. Martin had told her one day (and there was a blush as\nshe said it,) that it was impossible for any body to be a better son, and\ntherefore she was sure, whenever he married, he would make a good husband. Not\nthat she wanted him to marry. She was in no hurry at all.',
			'“Well done, Mrs. Martin!” thought Emma. “You know what you\nare about.”',
			'“And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs.\nGoddard a beautiful goose—the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever seen.\nMrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three teachers, Miss\nNash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with her.”',
			'“Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of\nhis own business? He does not read?”',
			'“Oh yes!—that is, no—I do not know—but I believe he has\nread a good deal—but not what you would think any thing of. He reads the\nAgricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the window\nseats—but he reads all them to himself. But sometimes of an\nevening, before we went to cards, he would read something aloud out of the\nElegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read the Vicar of\nWakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The Children of the\nAbbey. He had never heard of such books before I mentioned them, but he is\ndetermined to get them now as soon as ever he can.”',
			'The next question was—',
			'“What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?”',
			'“Oh! not handsome—not at all handsome. I thought him very plain at\nfirst, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know, after a\ntime. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every now and then, and he\nis sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston. He has passed you\nvery often.”',
			'“That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having any\nidea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot, is the very\nlast sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry are precisely the order\nof people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do. A degree or two lower, and\na creditable appearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful to their\nfamilies in some way or other. But a farmer can need none of my help, and is,\ntherefore, in one sense, as much above my notice as in every other he is below\nit.”',
			'“To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed him;\nbut he knows you very well indeed—I mean by sight.”',
			'“I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know,\nindeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imagine his age\nto be?”',
			'“He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the 23rd\njust a fortnight and a day’s difference—which is very odd.”',
			'“Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother is\nperfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as they are,\nand if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would probably repent it.\nSix years hence, if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same\nrank as his own, with a little money, it might be very desirable.”',
			'“Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years\nold!”',
			'“Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are not\nborn to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune entirely to\nmake—cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever money he might\ncome into when his father died, whatever his share of the family property, it\nis, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his stock, and so forth; and\nthough, with diligence and good luck, he may be rich in time, it is next to\nimpossible that he should have realised any thing yet.”',
			'“To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have no\nindoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks of\ntaking a boy another year.”',
			'“I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does\nmarry;—I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife—for though his\nsisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected to, it\ndoes not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice. The\nmisfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your\nassociates. There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman’s daughter,\nand you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own\npower, or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading\nyou.”',
			'“Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at Hartfield,\nand you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any body can\ndo.”',
			'“You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I would\nhave you so firmly established in good society, as to be independent even of\nHartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you permanently well connected, and\nto that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be;\nand, therefore, I say that if you should still be in this country when Mr.\nMartin marries, I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the\nsisters, to be acquainted with the wife, who will probably be some mere\nfarmer’s daughter, without education.”',
			'“To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body\nbut what had had some education—and been very well brought up. However, I\ndo not mean to set up my opinion against yours—and I am sure I shall not\nwish for the acquaintance of his wife. I shall always have a great regard for\nthe Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should be very sorry to give them\nup, for they are quite as well educated as me. But if he marries a very\nignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better not visit her, if I can help\nit.”',
			'Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no alarming\nsymptoms of love. The young man had been the first admirer, but she trusted\nthere was no other hold, and that there would be no serious difficulty, on\nHarriet’s side, to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own.',
			'They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the Donwell\nroad. He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at her, looked with\nmost unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. Emma was not sorry to have such\nan opportunity of survey; and walking a few yards forward, while they talked\ntogether, soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert\nMartin. His appearance was very neat, and he looked like a sensible young man,\nbut his person had no other advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with\ngentlemen, she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in\nHarriet’s inclination. Harriet was not insensible of manner; she had\nvoluntarily noticed her father’s gentleness with admiration as well as\nwonder. Mr. Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was.',
			'They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept\nwaiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face, and in a\nflutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to compose.',
			'“Only think of our happening to meet him!—How very odd! It was\nquite a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. He did not\nthink we ever walked this road. He thought we walked towards Randalls most\ndays. He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet. He was so busy\nthe last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it, but he goes again\nto-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet! Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he\nlike what you expected? What do you think of him? Do you think him so very\nplain?”',
			'“He is very plain, undoubtedly—remarkably plain:—but that is\nnothing compared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right to expect\nmuch, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be so very\nclownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him, I confess, a degree or\ntwo nearer gentility.”',
			'“To be sure,” said Harriet, in a mortified voice, “he is not\nso genteel as real gentlemen.”',
			'“I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been\nrepeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you must\nyourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. At Hartfield, you have\nhad very good specimens of well educated, well bred men. I should be surprized\nif, after seeing them, you could be in company with Mr. Martin again without\nperceiving him to be a very inferior creature—and rather wondering at\nyourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before. Do not you begin\nto feel that now? Were not you struck? I am sure you must have been struck by\nhis awkward look and abrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I\nheard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood here.”',
			'“Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. He has not such a fine air and\nway of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain enough. But Mr.\nKnightley is so very fine a man!”',
			'“Mr. Knightley’s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to\ncompare Mr. Martin with him. You might not see one in a hundred with\ngentleman so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he is not the only\ngentleman you have been lately used to. What say you to Mr. Weston and Mr.\nElton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of them. Compare their manner of\ncarrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being silent. You must see the\ndifference.”',
			'“Oh yes!—there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an\nold man. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.”',
			'“Which makes his good manners the more valuable. The older a person\ngrows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not be bad;\nthe more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or awkwardness\nbecomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in later age. Mr. Martin is\nnow awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr. Weston’s time of\nlife?”',
			'“There is no saying, indeed,” replied Harriet rather solemnly.',
			'“But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely gross,\nvulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of nothing but\nprofit and loss.”',
			'“Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.”',
			'“How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the\ncircumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended. He was\na great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else—which is\njust as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he to do with books? And I\nhave no doubt that he will thrive, and be a very rich man in\ntime—and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb\nus.”',
			'“I wonder he did not remember the book”—was all\nHarriet’s answer, and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which\nEmma thought might be safely left to itself. She, therefore, said no more for\nsome time. Her next beginning was,',
			'“In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton’s manners are superior to Mr.\nKnightley’s or Mr. Weston’s. They have more gentleness. They might\nbe more safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness, almost\na bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in him, because there\nis so much good-humour with it—but that would not do to be copied.\nNeither would Mr. Knightley’s downright, decided, commanding sort of\nmanner, though it suits him very well; his figure, and look, and\nsituation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to set about\ncopying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I think a young man\nmight be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model. Mr. Elton is\ngood-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. He seems to me to be grown\nparticularly gentle of late. I do not know whether he has any design of\ningratiating himself with either of us, Harriet, by additional softness, but it\nstrikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be. If he means any\nthing, it must be to please you. Did not I tell you what he said of you the\nother day?”',
			'She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr. Elton,\nand now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled, and said she had\nalways thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.',
			'Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out\nof Harriet’s head. She thought it would be an excellent match; and only\ntoo palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her to have much merit in\nplanning it. She feared it was what every body else must think of and predict.\nIt was not likely, however, that any body should have equalled her in the date\nof the plan, as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of\nHarriet’s coming to Hartfield. The longer she considered it, the greater\nwas her sense of its expediency. Mr. Elton’s situation was most suitable,\nquite the gentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not\nof any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet. He had\na comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient income; for\nthough the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known to have some\nindependent property; and she thought very highly of him as a good-humoured,\nwell-meaning, respectable young man, without any deficiency of useful\nunderstanding or knowledge of the world.',
			'She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl,\nwhich she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, was foundation\nenough on his side; and on Harriet’s there could be little doubt that the\nidea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy.\nAnd he was really a very pleasing young man, a young man whom any woman not\nfastidious might like. He was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired\nin general, though not by her, there being a want of elegance of feature which\nshe could not dispense with:—but the girl who could be gratified by a\nRobert Martin’s riding about the country to get walnuts for her might\nvery well be conquered by Mr. Elton’s admiration.',

		[
			'“I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,” said Mr.\nKnightley, “of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I\nthink it a bad thing.”',
			'“A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?—why so?”',
			'“I think they will neither of them do the other any good.”',
			'“You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her with a\nnew object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. I have been seeing\ntheir intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How very differently we\nfeel!—Not think they will do each other any good! This will certainly be\nthe beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr. Knightley.”',
			'“Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing\nWeston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.”',
			'“Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for he thinks\nexactly as I do on the subject. We were speaking of it only yesterday, and\nagreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that there should be such a girl in\nHighbury for her to associate with. Mr. Knightley, I shall not allow you to be\na fair judge in this case. You are so much used to live alone, that you do not\nknow the value of a companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the\ncomfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used to\nit all her life. I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith. She is not the\nsuperior young woman which Emma’s friend ought to be. But on the other\nhand, as Emma wants to see her better informed, it will be an inducement to her\nto read more herself. They will read together. She means it, I know.”',
			'“Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old.\nI have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times of books that\nshe meant to read regularly through—and very good lists they\nwere—very well chosen, and very neatly arranged—sometimes\nalphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew up when\nonly fourteen—I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit,\nthat I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have made out a very good\nlist now. But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from\nEmma. She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience, and a\nsubjection of the fancy to the understanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to\nstimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.—You\nnever could persuade her to read half so much as you wished.—You know you\ncould not.”',
			'“I dare say,” replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, “that I thought\nso then;—but since we have parted, I can never remember\nEmma’s omitting to do any thing I wished.”',
			'“There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as\nthat,”—said Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or\ntwo he had done. “But I,” he soon added, “who have had no\nsuch charm thrown over my senses, must still see, hear, and remember. Emma is\nspoiled by being the cleverest of her family. At ten years old, she had the\nmisfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at\nseventeen. She was always quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And\never since she was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all.\nIn her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her. She inherits her\nmother’s talents, and must have been under subjection to her.”',
			'“I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on your\nrecommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse’s family and wanted another\nsituation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body.\nI am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.”',
			'“Yes,” said he, smiling. “You are better placed here;\nvery fit for a wife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing\nyourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. You might\nnot give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise;\nbut you were receiving a very good education from her, on the very\nmaterial matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and doing as you were\nbid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife, I should certainly\nhave named Miss Taylor.”',
			'“Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife to such\na man as Mr. Weston.”',
			'“Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and that\nwith every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne. We will not\ndespair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort, or his\nson may plague him.”',
			'“I hope not that.—It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do\nnot foretell vexation from that quarter.”',
			'“Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to\nEmma’s genius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my heart,\nthe young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.—But\nHarriet Smith—I have not half done about Harriet Smith. I think her the\nvery worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. She knows nothing\nherself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. She is a flatterer in all\nher ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned. Her ignorance is hourly\nflattery. How can Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself, while\nHarriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority? And as for Harriet, I will\nventure to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will\nonly put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to. She will\ngrow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and\ncircumstances have placed her home. I am much mistaken if Emma’s\ndoctrines give any strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl adapt\nherself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life.—They only\ngive a little polish.”',
			'“I either depend more upon Emma’s good sense than you do, or am\nmore anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance. How\nwell she looked last night!”',
			'“Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you? Very\nwell; I shall not attempt to deny Emma’s being pretty.”',
			'“Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect\nbeauty than Emma altogether—face and figure?”',
			'“I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom\nseen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I am a partial old\nfriend.”',
			'“Such an eye!—the true hazle eye—and so brilliant! regular\nfeatures, open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,\nand such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure! There is\nhealth, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her glance. One\nhears sometimes of a child being ‘the picture of health;’ now, Emma\nalways gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health. She\nis loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?”',
			'“I have not a fault to find with her person,” he replied. “I\nthink her all you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise,\nthat I do not think her personally vain. Considering how very handsome she is,\nshe appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies another way. Mrs.\nWeston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith, or my dread\nof its doing them both harm.”',
			'“And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing\nthem any harm. With all dear Emma’s little faults, she is an excellent\ncreature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder sister, or a truer\nfriend? No, no; she has qualities which may be trusted; she will never lead any\none really wrong; she will make no lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she\nis in the right a hundred times.”',
			'“Very well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an angel, and I\nwill keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella. John\nloves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection, and Isabella\nalways thinks as he does; except when he is not quite frightened enough about\nthe children. I am sure of having their opinions with me.”',
			'“I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind; but\nexcuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself, you know,\nas having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma’s mother might\nhave had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can\narise from Harriet Smith’s intimacy being made a matter of much\ndiscussion among you. Pray excuse me; but supposing any little inconvenience\nmay be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be expected that Emma,\naccountable to nobody but her father, who perfectly approves the acquaintance,\nshould put an end to it, so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself. It\nhas been so many years my province to give advice, that you cannot be\nsurprized, Mr. Knightley, at this little remains of office.”',
			'“Not at all,” cried he; “I am much obliged to you for it. It\nis very good advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often\nfound; for it shall be attended to.”',
			'“Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy about\nher sister.”',
			'“Be satisfied,” said he, “I will not raise any outcry. I will\nkeep my ill-humour to myself. I have a very sincere interest in Emma. Isabella\ndoes not seem more my sister; has never excited a greater interest; perhaps\nhardly so great. There is an anxiety, a curiosity in what one feels for Emma. I\nwonder what will become of her!”',
			'“So do I,” said Mrs. Weston gently, “very much.”',
			'“She always declares she will never marry, which, of course, means just\nnothing at all. But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared\nfor. It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper\nobject. I should like to see Emma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it\nwould do her good. But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her; and she goes\nso seldom from home.”',
			'“There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution\nat present,” said Mrs. Weston, “as can well be; and while she is so\nhappy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would\nbe creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse’s account. I do not\nrecommend matrimony at present to Emma, though I mean no slight to the state, I\nassure you.”',
			'Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and Mr.\nWeston’s on the subject, as much as possible. There were wishes at\nRandalls respecting Emma’s destiny, but it was not desirable to have them\nsuspected; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to\n“What does Weston think of the weather; shall we have rain?”\nconvinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield.',

		[
			'Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet’s fancy a proper\ndirection and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose,\nfor she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr. Elton’s\nbeing a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners; and as she had no\nhesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints,\nshe was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet’s\nside, as there could be any occasion for. She was quite convinced of Mr.\nElton’s being in the fairest way of falling in love, if not in love\nalready. She had no scruple with regard to him. He talked of Harriet, and\npraised her so warmly, that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a\nlittle time would not add. His perception of the striking improvement of\nHarriet’s manner, since her introduction at Hartfield, was not one of the\nleast agreeable proofs of his growing attachment.',
			'“You have given Miss Smith all that she required,” said he;\n“you have made her graceful and easy. She was a beautiful creature when\nshe came to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added are\ninfinitely superior to what she received from nature.”',
			'“I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet only wanted\ndrawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She had all the natural grace\nof sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. I have done very\nlittle.”',
			'“If it were admissible to contradict a lady,” said the gallant Mr.\nElton—',
			'“I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, have\ntaught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before.”',
			'“Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me. So much superadded\ndecision of character! Skilful has been the hand!”',
			'“Great has been the pleasure, I am sure. I never met with a disposition\nmore truly amiable.”',
			'“I have no doubt of it.” And it was spoken with a sort of sighing\nanimation, which had a vast deal of the lover. She was not less pleased another\nday with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers, to have\nHarriet’s picture.',
			'“Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?” said she:\n“did you ever sit for your picture?”',
			'Harriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say, with a\nvery interesting naïveté,',
			'“Oh! dear, no, never.”',
			'No sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,',
			'“What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would\ngive any money for it. I almost long to attempt her likeness myself. You do not\nknow it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking\nlikenesses, and attempted several of my friends, and was thought to have a\ntolerable eye in general. But from one cause or another, I gave it up in\ndisgust. But really, I could almost venture, if Harriet would sit to me. It\nwould be such a delight to have her picture!”',
			'“Let me entreat you,” cried Mr. Elton; “it would indeed be a\ndelight! Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent\nin favour of your friend. I know what your drawings are. How could you suppose\nme ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers;\nand has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable figure-pieces in her drawing-room, at\nRandalls?”',
			'Yes, good man!—thought Emma—but what has all that to do with taking\nlikenesses? You know nothing of drawing. Don’t pretend to be in raptures\nabout mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet’s face. “Well, if you\ngive me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try what I can\ndo. Harriet’s features are very delicate, which makes a likeness\ndifficult; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines\nabout the mouth which one ought to catch.”',
			'“Exactly so—The shape of the eye and the lines about the\nmouth—I have not a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it. As you\nwill do it, it will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite\npossession.”',
			'“But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. She thinks so\nlittle of her own beauty. Did not you observe her manner of answering me? How\ncompletely it meant, ‘why should my picture be drawn?’”',
			'“Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me. But still I\ncannot imagine she would not be persuaded.”',
			'Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made; and she\nhad no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of\nboth the others. Emma wished to go to work directly, and therefore produced the\nportfolio containing her various attempts at portraits, for not one of them had\never been finished, that they might decide together on the best size for\nHarriet. Her many beginnings were displayed. Miniatures, half-lengths,\nwhole-lengths, pencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn.\nShe had always wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress both in\ndrawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would\never submit to. She played and sang;—and drew in almost every style; but\nsteadiness had always been wanting; and in nothing had she approached the\ndegree of excellence which she would have been glad to command, and ought not\nto have failed of. She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an\nartist or a musician, but she was not unwilling to have others deceived, or\nsorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved.',
			'There was merit in every drawing—in the least finished, perhaps the most;\nher style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there been ten\ntimes more, the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been\nthe same. They were both in ecstasies. A likeness pleases every body; and Miss\nWoodhouse’s performances must be capital.',
			'“No great variety of faces for you,” said Emma. “I had only\nmy own family to study from. There is my father—another of my\nfather—but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that\nI could only take him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. Mrs.\nWeston again, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston! always my\nkindest friend on every occasion. She would sit whenever I asked her. There is\nmy sister; and really quite her own little elegant figure!—and the face\nnot unlike. I should have made a good likeness of her, if she would have sat\nlonger, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she\nwould not be quiet. Then, here come all my attempts at three of those four\nchildren;—there they are, Henry and John and Bella, from one end of the\nsheet to the other, and any one of them might do for any one of the rest. She\nwas so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making\nchildren of three or four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very\neasy to take any likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they\nare coarser featured than any of mama’s children ever were. Here is my\nsketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him as he was sleeping on the\nsofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see.\nHe had nestled down his head most conveniently. That’s very like. I am\nrather proud of little George. The corner of the sofa is very good. Then here\nis my last,”—unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small\nsize, whole-length—“my last and my best—my brother, Mr. John\nKnightley.—This did not want much of being finished, when I put it away\nin a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness. I could not help being\nprovoked; for after all my pains, and when I had really made a very good\nlikeness of it—(Mrs. Weston and I were quite agreed in thinking it\nvery like)—only too handsome—too flattering—but that\nwas a fault on the right side”—after all this, came poor dear\nIsabella’s cold approbation of—“Yes, it was a little\nlike—but to be sure it did not do him justice. We had had a great deal of\ntrouble in persuading him to sit at all. It was made a great favour of; and\naltogether it was more than I could bear; and so I never would finish it, to\nhave it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness, to every morning visitor\nin Brunswick Square;—and, as I said, I did then forswear ever drawing any\nbody again. But for Harriet’s sake, or rather for my own, and as there\nare no husbands and wives in the case at present, I will break my\nresolution now.”',
			'Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and was\nrepeating, “No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as you\nobserve. Exactly so. No husbands and wives,” with so interesting a\nconsciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not better leave\nthem together at once. But as she wanted to be drawing, the declaration must\nwait a little longer.',
			'She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to be a\nwhole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley’s, and was\ndestined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourable station over\nthe mantelpiece.',
			'The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not keeping\nher attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of youthful\nexpression to the steady eyes of the artist. But there was no doing any thing,\nwith Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch. She gave him\ncredit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without\noffence; but was really obliged to put an end to it, and request him to place\nhimself elsewhere. It then occurred to her to employ him in reading.',
			'“If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness\nindeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen the\nirksomeness of Miss Smith’s.”',
			'Mr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew in peace. She\nmust allow him to be still frequently coming to look; any thing less would\ncertainly have been too little in a lover; and he was ready at the smallest\nintermission of the pencil, to jump up and see the progress, and be\ncharmed.—There was no being displeased with such an encourager, for his\nadmiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible. She could\nnot respect his eye, but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable.',
			'The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite enough pleased with\nthe first day’s sketch to wish to go on. There was no want of likeness,\nshe had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meant to throw in a little\nimprovement to the figure, to give a little more height, and considerably more\nelegance, she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing\nat last, and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both—a\nstanding memorial of the beauty of one, the skill of the other, and the\nfriendship of both; with as many other agreeable associations as Mr.\nElton’s very promising attachment was likely to add.',
			'Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,\nentreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.',
			'“By all means. We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the\nparty.”',
			'The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction, took\nplace on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the picture, which\nwas rapid and happy. Every body who saw it was pleased, but Mr. Elton was in\ncontinual raptures, and defended it through every criticism.',
			'“Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she\nwanted,”—observed Mrs. Weston to him—not in the least\nsuspecting that she was addressing a lover.—“The expression of the\neye is most correct, but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. It is\nthe fault of her face that she has them not.”',
			'“Do you think so?” replied he. “I cannot agree with you. It\nappears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never saw such a\nlikeness in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know.”',
			'“You have made her too tall, Emma,” said Mr. Knightley.',
			'Emma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly added,',
			'“Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. Consider, she\nis sitting down—which naturally presents a different—which in short\ngives exactly the idea—and the proportions must be preserved, you know.\nProportions, fore-shortening.—Oh no! it gives one exactly the idea of\nsuch a height as Miss Smith’s. Exactly so indeed!”',
			'“It is very pretty,” said Mr. Woodhouse. “So prettily done!\nJust as your drawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws so\nwell as you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she seems to\nbe sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her shoulders—and\nit makes one think she must catch cold.”',
			'“But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer.\nLook at the tree.”',
			'“But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.”',
			'“You, sir, may say any thing,” cried Mr. Elton, “but I must\nconfess that I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith out\nof doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! Any other\nsituation would have been much less in character. The naïveté of Miss\nSmith’s manners—and altogether—Oh, it is most admirable! I\ncannot keep my eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness.”',
			'The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a few\ndifficulties. It must be done directly; it must be done in London; the order\nmust go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be\ndepended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all commissions, must not be\napplied to, because it was December, and Mr. Woodhouse could not bear the idea\nof her stirring out of her house in the fogs of December. But no sooner was the\ndistress known to Mr. Elton, than it was removed. His gallantry was always on\nthe alert. “Might he be trusted with the commission, what infinite\npleasure should he have in executing it! he could ride to London at any time.\nIt was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on\nsuch an errand.”',
			'“He was too good!—she could not endure the thought!—she would\nnot give him such a troublesome office for the world,”—brought on\nthe desired repetition of entreaties and assurances,—and a very few\nminutes settled the business.',
			'Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, and give the\ndirections; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety\nwithout much incommoding him, while he seemed mostly fearful of not being\nincommoded enough.',
			'“What a precious deposit!” said he with a tender sigh, as he\nreceived it.',
			'“This man is almost too gallant to be in love,” thought Emma.\n“I should say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different\nways of being in love. He is an excellent young man, and will suit Harriet\nexactly; it will be an ‘Exactly so,’ as he says himself; but he\ndoes sigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I could\nendure as a principal. I come in for a pretty good share as a second. But it is\nhis gratitude on Harriet’s account.”',
		],
		[
			'The very day of Mr. Elton’s going to London produced a fresh occasion for\nEmma’s services towards her friend. Harriet had been at Hartfield, as\nusual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home to return again\nto dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been talked of, and with an\nagitated, hurried look, announcing something extraordinary to have happened\nwhich she was longing to tell. Half a minute brought it all out. She had heard,\nas soon as she got back to Mrs. Goddard’s, that Mr. Martin had been there\nan hour before, and finding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had\nleft a little parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; and on\nopening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songs which she\nhad lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this letter was from him,\nfrom Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal of marriage. “Who could\nhave thought it? She was so surprized she did not know what to do. Yes, quite a\nproposal of marriage; and a very good letter, at least she thought so. And he\nwrote as if he really loved her very much—but she did not know—and\nso, she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should\ndo.—” Emma was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased\nand so doubtful.',
			'“Upon my word,” she cried, “the young man is determined not\nto lose any thing for want of asking. He will connect himself well if he\ncan.”',
			'“Will you read the letter?” cried Harriet. “Pray do.\nII’d rather you would.”',
			'Emma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprized. The style of the\nletter was much above her expectation. There were not merely no grammatical\nerrors, but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman; the\nlanguage, though plain, was strong and unaffected, and the sentiments it\nconveyed very much to the credit of the writer. It was short, but expressed\ngood sense, warm attachment, liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling.\nShe paused over it, while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion,\nwith a “Well, well,” and was at last forced to add, “Is it a\ngood letter? or is it too short?”',
			'“Yes, indeed, a very good letter,” replied Emma rather\nslowly—“so good a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I\nthink one of his sisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine the young\nman whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if\nleft quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman; no,\ncertainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a woman. No\ndoubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural talent\nfor—thinks strongly and clearly—and when he takes a pen in hand,\nhis thoughts naturally find proper words. It is so with some men. Yes, I\nunderstand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a certain\npoint, not coarse. A better written letter, Harriet (returning it,) than I had\nexpected.”',
			'“Well,” said the still waiting\nHarriet;—“well—and—and what shall I do?”',
			'“What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this\nletter?”',
			'“Yes.”',
			'“But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course—and\nspeedily.”',
			'“Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.”',
			'“Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will express\nyourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your not being\nintelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be unequivocal; no\ndoubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain\nyou are inflicting as propriety requires, will present themselves unbidden to\nyour mind, I am persuaded. You need not be prompted to write with the\nappearance of sorrow for his disappointment.”',
			'“You think I ought to refuse him then,” said Harriet, looking down.',
			'“Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you in any\ndoubt as to that? I thought—but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been\nunder a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you feel in\ndoubt as to the purport of your answer. I had imagined you were\nconsulting me only as to the wording of it.”',
			'Harriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:',
			'“You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.”',
			'“No, I do not; that is, I do not mean—What shall I do? What would\nyou advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to\ndo.”',
			'“I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to do with\nit. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.”',
			'“I had no notion that he liked me so very much,” said Harriet,\ncontemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in her silence;\nbut beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too\npowerful, she thought it best to say,',
			'“I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman doubts\nas to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to refuse\nhim. If she can hesitate as to ‘Yes,’ she ought to say\n‘No’ directly. It is not a state to be safely entered into with\ndoubtful feelings, with half a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, and\nolder than yourself, to say thus much to you. But do not imagine that I want to\ninfluence you.”',
			'“Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to—but if you\nwould just advise me what I had best do—No, no, I do not mean\nthat—As you say, one’s mind ought to be quite made up—One\nshould not be hesitating—It is a very serious thing.—It will be\nsafer to say ‘No,’ perhaps.—Do you think I had better say\n‘No?’”',
			'“Not for the world,” said Emma, smiling graciously, “would I\nadvise you either way. You must be the best judge of your own happiness. If you\nprefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him the most agreeable\nman you have ever been in company with, why should you hesitate? You blush,\nHarriet.—Does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a\ndefinition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceive yourself; do not be run away with\nby gratitude and compassion. At this moment whom are you thinking of?”',
			'The symptoms were favourable.—Instead of answering, Harriet turned away\nconfused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter was still\nin her hand, it was now mechanically twisted about without regard. Emma waited\nthe result with impatience, but not without strong hopes. At last, with some\nhesitation, Harriet said—',
			'“Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as well\nas I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really almost made up\nmy mind—to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I am right?”',
			'“Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just what\nyou ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself, but\nnow that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving. Dear\nHarriet, I give myself joy of this. It would have grieved me to lose your\nacquaintance, which must have been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin.\nWhile you were in the smallest degree wavering, I said nothing about it,\nbecause I would not influence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to\nme. I could not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am\nsecure of you for ever.”',
			'Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her\nforcibly.',
			'“You could not have visited me!” she cried, looking aghast.\n“No, to be sure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That\nwould have been too dreadful!—What an escape!—Dear Miss Woodhouse,\nI would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any\nthing in the world.”',
			'“Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it\nmust have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all good society. I must\nhave given you up.”',
			'“Dear me!—How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed me\nnever to come to Hartfield any more!”',
			'“Dear affectionate creature!—You banished to Abbey-Mill\nFarm!—You confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all\nyour life! I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He\nmust have a pretty good opinion of himself.”',
			'“I do not think he is conceited either, in general,” said Harriet,\nher conscience opposing such censure; “at least, he is very good natured,\nand I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard\nfor—but that is quite a different thing from—and you know, though\nhe may like me, it does not follow that I should—and certainly I must\nconfess that since my visiting here I have seen people—and if one comes\nto compare them, person and manners, there is no comparison at all, one\nis so very handsome and agreeable. However, I do really think Mr. Martin a very\namiable young man, and have a great opinion of him; and his being so much\nattached to me—and his writing such a letter—but as to leaving you,\nit is what I would not do upon any consideration.”',
			'“Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not be parted.\nA woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, or because he is\nattached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.”',
			'“Oh no;—and it is but a short letter too.”',
			'Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a “very true;\nand it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish manner which might\nbe offending her every hour of the day, to know that her husband could write a\ngood letter.”',
			'“Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always\nhappy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refuse him. But how\nshall I do? What shall I say?”',
			'Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and advised its\nbeing written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of her assistance; and\nthough Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted, it was in\nfact given in the formation of every sentence. The looking over his letter\nagain, in replying to it, had such a softening tendency, that it was\nparticularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions; and she\nwas so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy, and thought so\nmuch of what his mother and sisters would think and say, and was so anxious\nthat they should not fancy her ungrateful, that Emma believed if the young man\nhad come in her way at that moment, he would have been accepted after all.',
			'This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The business was\nfinished, and Harriet safe. She was rather low all the evening, but Emma could\nallow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her\nown affection, sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr. Elton.',
			'“I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,” was said in rather\na sorrowful tone.',
			'“Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet. You\nare a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey-Mill.”',
			'“And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy but\nat Hartfield.”',
			'Some time afterwards it was, “I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much\nsurprized if she knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nash would—for\nMiss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only a\nlinen-draper.”',
			'“One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of\na school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an opportunity as\nthis of being married. Even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes. As\nto any thing superior for you, I suppose she is quite in the dark. The\nattentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle-tattle of\nHighbury yet. Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks\nand manners have explained themselves.”',
			'Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that people\nshould like her so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly cheering; but\nstill, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towards the rejected Mr.\nMartin.',
			'“Now he has got my letter,” said she softly. “I wonder what\nthey are all doing—whether his sisters know—if he is unhappy, they\nwill be unhappy too. I hope he will not mind it so very much.”',
			'“Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully\nemployed,” cried Emma. “At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton is\nshewing your picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful\nis the original, and after being asked for it five or six times, allowing them\nto hear your name, your own dear name.”',
			'“My picture!—But he has left my picture in Bond-street.”',
			'“Has he so!—Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear little\nmodest Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street till just\nbefore he mounts his horse to-morrow. It is his companion all this evening, his\nsolace, his delight. It opens his designs to his family, it introduces you\namong them, it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our\nnature, eager curiosity and warm prepossession. How cheerful, how animated, how\nsuspicious, how busy their imaginations all are!”',
			'Harriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.',

		[
			'Harriet slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past she had been\nspending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to have a\nbed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best in every respect,\nsafest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as possible just at present.\nShe was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs.\nGoddard’s, but it was then to be settled that she should return to\nHartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.',
			'While she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr. Woodhouse\nand Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up his mind to walk out,\nwas persuaded by his daughter not to defer it, and was induced by the\nentreaties of both, though against the scruples of his own civility, to leave\nMr. Knightley for that purpose. Mr. Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony\nabout him, was offering by his short, decided answers, an amusing contrast to\nthe protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other.',
			'“Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you will not\nconsider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma’s advice and go\nout for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is out, I believe I had better take my\nthree turns while I can. I treat you without ceremony, Mr. Knightley. We\ninvalids think we are privileged people.”',
			'“My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.”',
			'“I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will be happy to\nentertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three\nturns—my winter walk.”',
			'“You cannot do better, sir.”',
			'“I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, but I am a\nvery slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and, besides, you have\nanother long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey.”',
			'“Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think\nthe sooner you go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open the\ngarden door for you.”',
			'Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being immediately\noff likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for more chat. He began\nspeaking of Harriet, and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than Emma\nhad ever heard before.',
			'“I cannot rate her beauty as you do,” said he; “but she is a\npretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her\ndisposition. Her character depends upon those she is with; but in good hands\nshe will turn out a valuable woman.”',
			'“I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be\nwanting.”',
			'“Come,” said he, “you are anxious for a compliment, so I will\ntell you that you have improved her. You have cured her of her\nschool-girl’s giggle; she really does you credit.”',
			'“Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been\nof some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may.\nYou do not often overpower me with it.”',
			'“You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?”',
			'“Almost every moment. She has been gone longer already than she\nintended.”',
			'“Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.”',
			'“Highbury gossips!—Tiresome wretches!”',
			'“Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would.”',
			'Emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore said nothing. He\npresently added, with a smile,',
			'“I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you that I\nhave good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to\nher advantage.”',
			'“Indeed! how so? of what sort?”',
			'“A very serious sort, I assure you;” still smiling.',
			'“Very serious! I can think of but one thing—Who is in love with\nher? Who makes you their confidant?”',
			'Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton’s having dropt a hint. Mr.\nKnightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew Mr. Elton\nlooked up to him.',
			'“I have reason to think,” he replied, “that Harriet Smith\nwill soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable\nquarter:—Robert Martin is the man. Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this summer,\nseems to have done his business. He is desperately in love and means to marry\nher.”',
			'“He is very obliging,” said Emma; “but is he sure that\nHarriet means to marry him?”',
			'“Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He came to\nthe Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. He knows I have\na thorough regard for him and all his family, and, I believe, considers me as\none of his best friends. He came to ask me whether I thought it would be\nimprudent in him to settle so early; whether I thought her too young: in short,\nwhether I approved his choice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of\nher being considered (especially since your making so much of her) as in\na line of society above him. I was very much pleased with all that he said. I\nnever hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin. He always speaks to\nthe purpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He told me every\nthing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in the\nevent of his marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son and brother. I\nhad no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to me that he could\nafford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he could not do better. I\npraised the fair lady too, and altogether sent him away very happy. If he had\nnever esteemed my opinion before, he would have thought highly of me then; and,\nI dare say, left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever\nhad. This happened the night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he\nwould not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does\nnot appear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should be at\nMrs. Goddard’s to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor, without\nthinking him at all a tiresome wretch.”',
			'“Pray, Mr. Knightley,” said Emma, who had been smiling to herself\nthrough a great part of this speech, “how do you know that Mr. Martin did\nnot speak yesterday?”',
			'“Certainly,” replied he, surprized, “I do not absolutely know\nit; but it may be inferred. Was not she the whole day with you?”',
			'“Come,” said she, “I will tell you something, in return for\nwhat you have told me. He did speak yesterday—that is, he wrote, and was\nrefused.”',
			'This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr. Knightley\nactually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he stood up, in tall\nindignation, and said,',
			'“Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What is the\nfoolish girl about?”',
			'“Oh! to be sure,” cried Emma, “it is always incomprehensible\nto a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man always\nimagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.”',
			'“Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is the meaning\nof this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it is so; but I hope\nyou are mistaken.”',
			'“I saw her answer!—nothing could be clearer.”',
			'“You saw her answer!—you wrote her answer too. Emma, this is your\ndoing. You persuaded her to refuse him.”',
			'“And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should not feel\nthat I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man, but I cannot\nadmit him to be Harriet’s equal; and am rather surprized indeed that he\nshould have ventured to address her. By your account, he does seem to have had\nsome scruples. It is a pity that they were ever got over.”',
			'“Not Harriet’s equal!” exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and\nwarmly; and with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, “No,\nhe is not her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in\nsituation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are Harriet\nSmith’s claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any connexion\nhigher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom,\nwith probably no settled provision at all, and certainly no respectable\nrelations. She is known only as parlour-boarder at a common school. She is not\na sensible girl, nor a girl of any information. She has been taught nothing\nuseful, and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself. At\nher age she can have no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely\never to have any that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is good tempered,\nand that is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on his account, as\nbeing beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him. I felt that, as to\nfortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that as to a rational\ncompanion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse. But I could not reason so\nto a man in love, and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her, to\nher having that sort of disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be\neasily led aright and turn out very well. The advantage of the match I felt to\nbe all on her side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there\nwould be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck. Even your\nsatisfaction I made sure of. It crossed my mind immediately that you would not\nregret your friend’s leaving Highbury, for the sake of her being settled\nso well. I remember saying to myself, ‘Even Emma, with all her partiality\nfor Harriet, will think this a good match.’”',
			'“I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any\nsuch thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all his merit Mr.\nMartin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate friend! Not regret her\nleaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an\nacquaintance of my own! I wonder you should think it possible for me to have\nsuch feelings. I assure you mine are very different. I must think your\nstatement by no means fair. You are not just to Harriet’s claims. They\nwould be estimated very differently by others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may\nbe the richest of the two, but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in\nsociety.—The sphere in which she moves is much above his.—It would\nbe a degradation.”',
			'“A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a\nrespectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!”',
			'“As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she may be\ncalled Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not to pay for the\noffence of others, by being held below the level of those with whom she is\nbrought up.—There can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a\ngentleman—and a gentleman of fortune.—Her allowance is very\nliberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or\ncomfort.—That she is a gentleman’s daughter, is indubitable to me;\nthat she associates with gentlemen’s daughters, no one, I apprehend, will\ndeny.—She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.”',
			'“Whoever might be her parents,” said Mr. Knightley, “whoever\nmay have had the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part of\ntheir plan to introduce her into what you would call good society. After\nreceiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs. Goddard’s\nhands to shift as she can;—to move, in short, in Mrs. Goddard’s\nline, to have Mrs. Goddard’s acquaintance. Her friends evidently thought\nthis good enough for her; and it was good enough. She desired nothing\nbetter herself. Till you chose to turn her into a friend, her mind had no\ndistaste for her own set, nor any ambition beyond it. She was as happy as\npossible with the Martins in the summer. She had no sense of superiority then.\nIf she has it now, you have given it. You have been no friend to Harriet Smith,\nEmma. Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far, if he had not felt\npersuaded of her not being disinclined to him. I know him well. He has too much\nreal feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion. And as\nto conceit, he is the farthest from it of any man I know. Depend upon it he had\nencouragement.”',
			'It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion;\nshe chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again.',
			'“You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before, are\nunjust to Harriet. Harriet’s claims to marry well are not so contemptible\nas you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but she has better sense than\nyou are aware of, and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so\nslightingly. Waiving that point, however, and supposing her to be, as you\ndescribe her, only pretty and good-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree\nshe possesses them, they are not trivial recommendations to the world in\ngeneral, for she is, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by\nninety-nine people out of an hundred; and till it appears that men are much\nmore philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed;\ntill they do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a\ngirl, with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired and\nsought after, of having the power of chusing from among many, consequently a\nclaim to be nice. Her good-nature, too, is not so very slight a claim,\ncomprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness of temper and manner, a\nvery humble opinion of herself, and a great readiness to be pleased with other\npeople. I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such\nbeauty, and such temper, the highest claims a woman could possess.”',
			'“Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almost\nenough to make me think so too. Better be without sense, than misapply it as\nyou do.”',
			'“To be sure!” cried she playfully. “I know that is the\nfeeling of you all. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every\nman delights in—what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his\njudgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you, yourself, ever to marry,\nshe is the very woman for you. And is she, at seventeen, just entering into\nlife, just beginning to be known, to be wondered at because she does not accept\nthe first offer she receives? No—pray let her have time to look about\nher.”',
			'“I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,” said Mr.\nKnightley presently, “though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now\nperceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. You will puff her\nup with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has a claim to, that, in\na little while, nobody within her reach will be good enough for her. Vanity\nworking on a weak head, produces every sort of mischief. Nothing so easy as for\na young lady to raise her expectations too high. Miss Harriet Smith may not\nfind offers of marriage flow in so fast, though she is a very pretty girl. Men\nof sense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives. Men of family\nwould not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such\nobscurity—and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and\ndisgrace they might be involved in, when the mystery of her parentage came to\nbe revealed. Let her marry Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable, and\nhappy for ever; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly, and teach\nher to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large\nfortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard’s all the rest of\nher life—or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry\nsomebody or other,) till she grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the old\nwriting-master’s son.”',
			'“We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, that there\ncan be no use in canvassing it. We shall only be making each other more angry.\nBut as to my letting her marry Robert Martin, it is impossible; she has\nrefused him, and so decidedly, I think, as must prevent any second application.\nShe must abide by the evil of having refused him, whatever it may be; and as to\nthe refusal itself, I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a\nlittle; but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do.\nHis appearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad, that if she ever\nwere disposed to favour him, she is not now. I can imagine, that before she had\nseen any body superior, she might tolerate him. He was the brother of her\nfriends, and he took pains to please her; and altogether, having seen nobody\nbetter (that must have been his great assistant) she might not, while she was\nat Abbey-Mill, find him disagreeable. But the case is altered now. She knows\nnow what gentlemen are; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has\nany chance with Harriet.”',
			'“Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!” cried Mr.\nKnightley.—“Robert Martin’s manners have sense, sincerity,\nand good-humour to recommend them; and his mind has more true gentility than\nHarriet Smith could understand.”',
			'Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was really\nfeeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone. She did not repent\nwhat she had done; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of\nfemale right and refinement than he could be; but yet she had a sort of\nhabitual respect for his judgment in general, which made her dislike having it\nso loudly against her; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry\nstate, was very disagreeable. Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence,\nwith only one attempt on Emma’s side to talk of the weather, but he made\nno answer. He was thinking. The result of his thoughts appeared at last in\nthese words.',
			'“Robert Martin has no great loss—if he can but think so; and I hope\nit will not be long before he does. Your views for Harriet are best known to\nyourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it is fair to\nsuppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;—and as a friend I\nshall just hint to you that if Elton is the man, I think it will be all labour\nin vain.”',
			'Emma laughed and disclaimed. He continued,',
			'“Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort of man, and\na very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely to make an\nimprudent match. He knows the value of a good income as well as any body. Elton\nmay talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally. He is as well acquainted\nwith his own claims, as you can be with Harriet’s. He knows that he is a\nvery handsome young man, and a great favourite wherever he goes; and from his\ngeneral way of talking in unreserved moments, when there are only men present,\nI am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away. I have heard him\nspeak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters\nare intimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece.”',
			'“I am very much obliged to you,” said Emma, laughing again.\n“If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton’s marrying Harriet, it would\nhave been very kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet\nto myself. I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope to equal my\nown doings at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well.”',
			'“Good morning to you,”—said he, rising and walking off\nabruptly. He was very much vexed. He felt the disappointment of the young man,\nand was mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he\nhad given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair,\nwas provoking him exceedingly.',
			'Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more indistinctness in\nthe causes of her’s, than in his. She did not always feel so absolutely\nsatisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and\nher adversary’s wrong, as Mr. Knightley. He walked off in more complete\nself-approbation than he left for her. She was not so materially cast down,\nhowever, but that a little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate\nrestoratives. Harriet’s staying away so long was beginning to make her\nuneasy. The possibility of the young man’s coming to Mrs. Goddard’s\nthat morning, and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause, gave\nalarming ideas. The dread of such a failure after all became the prominent\nuneasiness; and when Harriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without\nhaving any such reason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction\nwhich settled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr. Knightley\nthink or say what he would, she had done nothing which woman’s friendship\nand woman’s feelings would not justify.',
			'He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered that\nMr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done, neither with the\ninterest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself, in spite of Mr.\nKnightley’s pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on such a\nquestion as herself, that he had spoken it hastily and in anger, she was able\nto believe, that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true, than\nwhat he knew any thing about. He certainly might have heard Mr. Elton speak\nwith more unreserve than she had ever done, and Mr. Elton might not be of an\nimprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to money matters; he might naturally be\nrather attentive than otherwise to them; but then, Mr. Knightley did not make\ndue allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested\nmotives. Mr. Knightley saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of\nits effects; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any\nhesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest; and more than\na reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she was very sure did not belong to\nMr. Elton.',
			'Harriet’s cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, not\nto think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss Nash had been telling\nher something, which she repeated immediately with great delight. Mr. Perry had\nbeen to Mrs. Goddard’s to attend a sick child, and Miss Nash had seen\nhim, and he had told Miss Nash, that as he was coming back yesterday from\nClayton Park, he had met Mr. Elton, and found to his great surprize, that Mr.\nElton was actually on his road to London, and not meaning to return till the\nmorrow, though it was the whist-club night, which he had been never known to\nmiss before; and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how\nshabby it was in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much\nto persuade him to put off his journey only one day; but it would not do; Mr.\nElton had been determined to go on, and had said in a very\nparticular way indeed, that he was going on business which he would not\nput off for any inducement in the world; and something about a very enviable\ncommission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious. Mr. Perry\ncould not quite understand him, but he was very sure there must be a\nlady in the case, and he told him so; and Mr. Elton only looked very\nconscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits. Miss Nash had told her\nall this, and had talked a great deal more about Mr. Elton; and said, looking\nso very significantly at her, “that she did not pretend to understand\nwhat his business might be, but she only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton\ncould prefer, she should think the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a\ndoubt, Mr. Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness.”',
		],
		[
			'Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel with herself.\nHe was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual before he came to\nHartfield again; and when they did meet, his grave looks shewed that she was\nnot forgiven. She was sorry, but could not repent. On the contrary, her plans\nand proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general\nappearances of the next few days.',
			'The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr. Elton’s\nreturn, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting-room, he got\nup to look at it, and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he\nought; and as for Harriet’s feelings, they were visibly forming\nthemselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of\nmind admitted. Emma was soon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin’s being no\notherwise remembered, than as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the\nutmost advantage to the latter.',
			'Her views of improving her little friend’s mind, by a great deal of\nuseful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a few first\nchapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It was much easier to chat\nthan to study; much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at\nHarriet’s fortune, than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or\nexercise it on sober facts; and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet\nat present, the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life,\nwas the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she\ncould meet with, into a thin quarto of hot-pressed paper, made up by her\nfriend, and ornamented with ciphers and trophies.',
			'In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are not\nuncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard’s, had written out at\nleast three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the first hint of it from her,\nhoped, with Miss Woodhouse’s help, to get a great many more. Emma\nassisted with her invention, memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote a very\npretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order, in form as\nwell as quantity.',
			'Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls, and\ntried very often to recollect something worth their putting in. “So many\nclever riddles as there used to be when he was young—he wondered he could\nnot remember them! but he hoped he should in time.” And it always ended\nin “Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.”',
			'His good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject, did not at\npresent recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he had desired Perry to be\nupon the watch, and as he went about so much, something, he thought, might come\nfrom that quarter.',
			'It was by no means his daughter’s wish that the intellects of Highbury in\ngeneral should be put under requisition. Mr. Elton was the only one whose\nassistance she asked. He was invited to contribute any really good enigmas,\ncharades, or conundrums that he might recollect; and she had the pleasure of\nseeing him most intently at work with his recollections; and at the same time,\nas she could perceive, most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant, nothing\nthat did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips. They owed to\nhim their two or three politest puzzles; and the joy and exultation with which\nat last he recalled, and rather sentimentally recited, that well-known charade,',
			'My first doth affliction denote,\n    Which my second is destin’d to feel\nAnd my whole is the best antidote\n    That affliction to soften and heal.—',
			'made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago\nalready.',
			'“Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?” said she;\n“that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be easier\nto you.”',
			'“Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind in his\nlife. The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even Miss\nWoodhouse”—he stopt a moment—“or Miss Smith could\ninspire him.”',
			'The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration. He called for a\nfew moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing, as he\nsaid, a charade, which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady, the\nobject of his admiration, but which, from his manner, Emma was immediately\nconvinced must be his own.',
			'“I do not offer it for Miss Smith’s collection,” said he.\n“Being my friend’s, I have no right to expose it in any degree to\nthe public eye, but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.”',
			'The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma could understand. There\nwas deep consciousness about him, and he found it easier to meet her eye than\nher friend’s. He was gone the next moment:—after another\nmoment’s pause,',
			'“Take it,” said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards\nHarriet—“it is for you. Take your own.”',
			'But Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, never loth to be\nfirst, was obliged to examine it herself.',
			'To Miss——',
			'CHARADE.',
			'My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,\n    Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.\nAnother view of man, my second brings,\n    Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\n\nBut ah! united, what reverse we have!\n    Man’s boasted power and freedom, all are flown;\nLord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,\n    And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\n\n    Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,\n    May its approval beam in that soft eye!',
			'She cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it through again\nto be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then passing it to\nHarriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself, while Harriet was puzzling\nover the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness, “Very well, Mr.\nElton, very well indeed. I have read worse charades. Courtship—a\nvery good hint. I give you credit for it. This is feeling your way. This is\nsaying very plainly—‘Pray, Miss Smith, give me leave to pay my\naddresses to you. Approve my charade and my intentions in the same\nglance.’',
			'May its approval beam in that soft eye!',
			'Harriet exactly. Soft is the very word for her eye—of all epithets, the\njustest that could be given.',
			'Thy ready wit the word will soon supply.',
			'Humph—Harriet’s ready wit! All the better. A man must be very much\nin love, indeed, to describe her so. Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish you had the\nbenefit of this; I think this would convince you. For once in your life you\nwould be obliged to own yourself mistaken. An excellent charade indeed! and\nvery much to the purpose. Things must come to a crisis soon now.”',
			'She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations, which were\notherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the eagerness of\nHarriet’s wondering questions.',
			'“What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?—what can it be? I have not an\nidea—I cannot guess it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do try to\nfind it out, Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any thing so hard. Is it\nkingdom? I wonder who the friend was—and who could be the young lady. Do\nyou think it is a good one? Can it be woman?',
			'And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.',
			'Can it be Neptune?',
			'Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!',
			'Or a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only one syllable. It\nmust be very clever, or he would not have brought it. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do\nyou think we shall ever find it out?”',
			'“Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you thinking\nof? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a\nmermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen.',
			'For Miss ———, read Miss Smith.',
			'My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,\n    Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.',
			'That is court.',
			'Another view of man, my second brings;\n    Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!',
			'That is ship;—plain as it can be.—Now for the cream.',
			'But ah! united, (courtship, you know,) what reverse we have!\n    Man’s boasted power and freedom, all are flown.\nLord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,\n    And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.',
			'A very proper compliment!—and then follows the application, which I\nthink, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending. Read\nit in comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt of its being written for you\nand to you.”',
			'Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. She read the\nconcluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. She could not speak. But\nshe was not wanted to speak. It was enough for her to feel. Emma spoke for her.',
			'“There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this\ncompliment,” said she, “that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr.\nElton’s intentions. You are his object—and you will soon receive\nthe completest proof of it. I thought it must be so. I thought I could not be\nso deceived; but now, it is clear; the state of his mind is as clear and\ndecided, as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you. Yes,\nHarriet, just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen that\nhas happened. I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr.\nElton were most desirable or most natural. Its probability and its eligibility\nhave really so equalled each other! I am very happy. I congratulate you, my\ndear Harriet, with all my heart. This is an attachment which a woman may well\nfeel pride in creating. This is a connexion which offers nothing but good. It\nwill give you every thing that you want—consideration, independence, a\nproper home—it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends, close\nto Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy for ever. This, Harriet, is an\nalliance which can never raise a blush in either of us.”',
			'“Dear Miss Woodhouse!”—and “Dear Miss Woodhouse,”\nwas all that Harriet, with many tender embraces could articulate at first; but\nwhen they did arrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently\nclear to her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered just as she\nought. Mr. Elton’s superiority had very ample acknowledgment.',
			'“Whatever you say is always right,” cried Harriet, “and\ntherefore I suppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could\nnot have imagined it. It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. Mr. Elton, who\nmight marry any body! There cannot be two opinions about him. He is so\nvery superior. Only think of those sweet verses—‘To Miss\n———.’ Dear me, how clever!—Could it really be\nmeant for me?”',
			'“I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that. It is a\ncertainty. Receive it on my judgment. It is a sort of prologue to the play, a\nmotto to the chapter; and will be soon followed by matter-of-fact prose.”',
			'“It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected. I am sure, a\nmonth ago, I had no more idea myself!—The strangest things do take\nplace!”',
			'“When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted—they do\nindeed—and really it is strange; it is out of the common course that what\nis so evidently, so palpably desirable—what courts the pre-arrangement of\nother people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form. You and\nMr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong to one another by every\ncircumstance of your respective homes. Your marrying will be equal to the match\nat Randalls. There does seem to be a something in the air of Hartfield which\ngives love exactly the right direction, and sends it into the very channel\nwhere it ought to flow.',
			'The course of true love never did run smooth—',
			'A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that\npassage.”',
			'“That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,—me, of all\npeople, who did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he, the very\nhandsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body looks up to, quite like\nMr. Knightley! His company so sought after, that every body says he need not\neat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it; that he has more\ninvitations than there are days in the week. And so excellent in the Church!\nMiss Nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to\nHighbury. Dear me! When I look back to the first time I saw him! How little did\nI think!—The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through\nthe blind when we heard he was going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us\naway, and staid to look through herself; however, she called me back presently,\nand let me look too, which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought\nhe looked! He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole.”',
			'“This is an alliance which, whoever—whatever your friends may be,\nmust be agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense; and we are\nnot to be addressing our conduct to fools. If they are anxious to see you\nhappily married, here is a man whose amiable character gives every\nassurance of it;—if they wish to have you settled in the same country and\ncircle which they have chosen to place you in, here it will be accomplished;\nand if their only object is that you should, in the common phrase, be\nwell married, here is the comfortable fortune, the respectable\nestablishment, the rise in the world which must satisfy them.”',
			'“Yes, very true. How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. You understand\nevery thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the other. This\ncharade!—If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could never have made any\nthing like it.”',
			'“I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining it\nyesterday.”',
			'“I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever\nread.”',
			'“I never read one more to the purpose, certainly.”',
			'“It is as long again as almost all we have had before.”',
			'“I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. Such things\nin general cannot be too short.”',
			'Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear. The most satisfactory comparisons\nwere rising in her mind.',
			'“It is one thing,” said she, presently—her cheeks in a\nglow—“to have very good sense in a common way, like every body\nelse, and if there is any thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say\njust what you must, in a short way; and another, to write verses and charades\nlike this.”',
			'Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin’s\nprose.',
			'“Such sweet lines!” continued Harriet—“these two\nlast!—But how shall I ever be able to return the paper, or say I have\nfound it out?—Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what can we do about that?”',
			'“Leave it to me. You do nothing. He will be here this evening, I dare\nsay, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense or other will pass\nbetween us, and you shall not be committed.—Your soft eyes shall chuse\ntheir own time for beaming. Trust to me.”',
			'“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful\ncharade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good.”',
			'“Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should not\nwrite it into your book.”',
			'“Oh! but those two lines are”—',
			'—“The best of all. Granted;—for private enjoyment; and for\nprivate enjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written you know,\nbecause you divide them. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does its meaning\nchange. But take it away, and all appropriation ceases, and a very\npretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection. Depend upon it, he\nwould not like to have his charade slighted, much better than his passion. A\npoet in love must be encouraged in both capacities, or neither. Give me the\nbook, I will write it down, and then there can be no possible reflection on\nyou.”',
			'Harriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts, so as to\nfeel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love. It\nseemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity.',
			'“I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,” said she.',
			'“Very well,” replied Emma; “a most natural feeling; and the\nlonger it lasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my father coming:\nyou will not object to my reading the charade to him. It will be giving him so\nmuch pleasure! He loves any thing of the sort, and especially any thing that\npays woman a compliment. He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us\nall!—You must let me read it to him.”',
			'Harriet looked grave.',
			'“My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this\ncharade.—You will betray your feelings improperly, if you are too\nconscious and too quick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all\nthe meaning which may be affixed to it. Do not be overpowered by such a little\ntribute of admiration. If he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not have\nleft the paper while I was by; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards\nyou. Do not let us be too solemn on the business. He has encouragement enough\nto proceed, without our sighing out our souls over this charade.”',
			'“Oh! no—I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you\nplease.”',
			'Mr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, by the\nrecurrence of his very frequent inquiry of “Well, my dears, how does your\nbook go on?—Have you got any thing fresh?”',
			'“Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. A piece\nof paper was found on the table this morning—(dropt, we suppose, by a\nfairy)—containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied it\nin.”',
			'She read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowly and\ndistinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of every part as she\nproceeded—and he was very much pleased, and, as she had foreseen,\nespecially struck with the complimentary conclusion.',
			'“Aye, that’s very just, indeed, that’s very properly said.\nVery true. ‘Woman, lovely woman.’ It is such a pretty charade, my\ndear, that I can easily guess what fairy brought it.—Nobody could have\nwritten so prettily, but you, Emma.”',
			'Emma only nodded, and smiled.—After a little thinking, and a very tender\nsigh, he added,',
			'“Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother was\nso clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I can remember\nnothing;—not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention;\nI can only recollect the first stanza; and there are several.',
			'Kitty, a fair but frozen maid,\n    Kindled a flame I yet deplore,\nThe hood-wink’d boy I called to aid,\nThough of his near approach afraid,\n    So fatal to my suit before.',
			'And that is all that I can recollect of it—but it is very clever all the\nway through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.”',
			'“Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from the\nElegant Extracts. It was Garrick’s, you know.”',
			'“Aye, very true.—I wish I could recollect more of it.',
			'Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.',
			'The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near being\nchristened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall have her here next\nweek. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall put her—and what room\nthere will be for the children?”',
			'“Oh! yes—she will have her own room, of course; the room she always\nhas;—and there is the nursery for the children,—just as usual, you\nknow. Why should there be any change?”',
			'“I do not know, my dear—but it is so long since she was\nhere!—not since last Easter, and then only for a few days.—Mr. John\nKnightley’s being a lawyer is very inconvenient.—Poor\nIsabella!—she is sadly taken away from us all!—and how sorry she\nwill be when she comes, not to see Miss Taylor here!”',
			'“She will not be surprized, papa, at least.”',
			'“I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I first\nheard she was going to be married.”',
			'“We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is\nhere.”',
			'“Yes, my dear, if there is time.—But—(in a very depressed\ntone)—she is coming for only one week. There will not be time for any\nthing.”',
			'“It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer—but it seems a case\nof necessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, and we\nought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of the time they can\ngive to the country, that two or three days are not to be taken out for the\nAbbey. Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim this Christmas—though\nyou know it is longer since they were with him, than with us.”',
			'“It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to be\nanywhere but at Hartfield.”',
			'Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley’s claims on his\nbrother, or any body’s claims on Isabella, except his own. He sat musing\na little while, and then said,',
			'“But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon,\nthough he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with\nus. She and the children might stay very well.”',
			'“Ah! papa—that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and\nI do not think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her\nhusband.”',
			'This was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse could\nonly give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits affected by the idea\nof his daughter’s attachment to her husband, she immediately led to such\na branch of the subject as must raise them.',
			'“Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother\nand sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with the children. We are\nvery proud of the children, are not we, papa? I wonder which she will think the\nhandsomest, Henry or John?”',
			'“Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they will be\nto come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.”',
			'“I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not.”',
			'“Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. Henry is the\neldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, the second, is named\nafter his father. Some people are surprized, I believe, that the eldest was\nnot, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which I thought very pretty of\nher. And he is a very clever boy, indeed. They are all remarkably clever; and\nthey have so many pretty ways. They will come and stand by my chair, and say,\n‘Grandpapa, can you give me a bit of string?’ and once Henry asked\nme for a knife, but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas. I think\ntheir father is too rough with them very often.”',
			'“He appears rough to you,” said Emma, “because you are so\nvery gentle yourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, you would\nnot think him rough. He wishes his boys to be active and hardy; and if they\nmisbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then; but he is an affectionate\nfather—certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate father. The\nchildren are all fond of him.”',
			'“And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling in a\nvery frightful way!”',
			'“But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It is such\nenjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their\ntaking turns, whichever began would never give way to the other.”',
			'“Well, I cannot understand it.”',
			'“That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot\nunderstand the pleasures of the other.”',
			'Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate in\npreparation for the regular four o’clock dinner, the hero of this\ninimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; but Emma could receive\nhim with the usual smile, and her quick eye soon discerned in his the\nconsciousness of having made a push—of having thrown a die; and she\nimagined he was come to see how it might turn up. His ostensible reason,\nhowever, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse’s party could be made up in the\nevening without him, or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary\nat Hartfield. If he were, every thing else must give way; but otherwise his\nfriend Cole had been saying so much about his dining with him—had made\nsuch a point of it, that he had promised him conditionally to come.',
			'Emma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their\naccount; her father was sure of his rubber. He re-urged—she re-declined;\nand he seemed then about to make his bow, when taking the paper from the table,\nshe returned it—',
			'“Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us; thank\nyou for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I have ventured to write\nit into Miss Smith’s collection. Your friend will not take it amiss I\nhope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines.”',
			'Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He looked rather\ndoubtingly—rather confused; said something about\n“honour,”—glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the\nbook open on the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively. With the\nview of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said,',
			'“You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade must\nnot be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman’s\napprobation while he writes with such gallantry.”',
			'“I have no hesitation in saying,” replied Mr. Elton, though\nhesitating a good deal while he spoke; “I have no hesitation in\nsaying—at least if my friend feels at all as I do—I have not\nthe smallest doubt that, could he see his little effusion honoured as I\nsee it, (looking at the book again, and replacing it on the table), he would\nconsider it as the proudest moment of his life.”',
			'After this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could not think it too\nsoon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there was a sort of parade\nin his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh. She ran away to\nindulge the inclination, leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to\nHarriet’s share.',

		[
			'Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather to prevent the\nyoung ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the morrow, Emma had a\ncharitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, who lived a little way out of\nHighbury.',
			'Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane leading at\nright angles from the broad, though irregular, main street of the place; and,\nas may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of Mr. Elton. A few inferior\ndwellings were first to be passed, and then, about a quarter of a mile down the\nlane rose the Vicarage, an old and not very good house, almost as close to the\nroad as it could be. It had no advantage of situation; but had been very much\nsmartened up by the present proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no\npossibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and\nobserving eyes.—Emma’s remark was—',
			'“There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these\ndays.”—Harriet’s was—',
			'“Oh, what a sweet house!—How very beautiful!—There are the\nyellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much.”',
			'“I do not often walk this way now,” said Emma, as they\nproceeded, “but then there will be an inducement, and I shall\ngradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and\npollards of this part of Highbury.”',
			'Harriet, she found, had never in her life been inside the Vicarage, and her\ncuriosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors and\nprobabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love, with Mr.\nElton’s seeing ready wit in her.',
			'“I wish we could contrive it,” said she; “but I cannot think\nof any tolerable pretence for going in;—no servant that I want to inquire\nabout of his housekeeper—no message from my father.”',
			'She pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence of some\nminutes, Harriet thus began again—',
			'“I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or going\nto be married! so charming as you are!”—',
			'Emma laughed, and replied,',
			'“My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry; I\nmust find other people charming—one other person at least. And I am not\nonly, not going to be married, at present, but have very little intention of\never marrying at all.”',
			'“Ah!—so you say; but I cannot believe it.”',
			'“I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be\ntempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of the question:\nand I do not wish to see any such person. I would rather not be tempted.\nI cannot really change for the better. If I were to marry, I must expect to\nrepent it.”',
			'“Dear me!—it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!”—',
			'“I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to fall\nin love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have been in love;\nit is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever shall. And, without\nlove, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a situation as mine. Fortune\nI do not want; employment I do not want; consequence I do not want: I believe\nfew married women are half as much mistress of their husband’s house as I\nam of Hartfield; and never, never could I expect to be so truly beloved and\nimportant; so always first and always right in any man’s eyes as I am in\nmy father’s.”',
			'“But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!”',
			'“That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I\nthought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly—so satisfied—so\nsmiling—so prosing—so undistinguishing and unfastidious—and\nso apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry\nto-morrow. But between us, I am convinced there never can be any\nlikeness, except in being unmarried.”',
			'“But still, you will be an old maid! and that’s so dreadful!”',
			'“Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty\nonly which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! A single woman,\nwith a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable old maid! the\nproper sport of boys and girls, but a single woman, of good fortune, is always\nrespectable, and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else. And the\ndistinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the\nworld as appears at first; for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract\nthe mind, and sour the temper. Those who can barely live, and who live perforce\nin a very small, and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal\nand cross. This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too good\nnatured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very much to the\ntaste of every body, though single and though poor. Poverty certainly has not\ncontracted her mind: I really believe, if she had only a shilling in the world,\nshe would be very likely to give away sixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of\nher: that is a great charm.”',
			'“Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you\ngrow old?”',
			'“If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great\nmany independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more in want\nof employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty. Woman’s usual\noccupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now; or\nwith no important variation. If I draw less, I shall read more; if I give up\nmusic, I shall take to carpet-work. And as for objects of interest, objects for\nthe affections, which is in truth the great point of inferiority, the want of\nwhich is really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying, I shall be\nvery well off, with all the children of a sister I love so much, to care about.\nThere will be enough of them, in all probability, to supply every sort of\nsensation that declining life can need. There will be enough for every hope and\nevery fear; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent, it\nsuits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder. My nephews\nand nieces!—I shall often have a niece with me.”',
			'“Do you know Miss Bates’s niece? That is, I know you must have seen\nher a hundred times—but are you acquainted?”',
			'“Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to\nHighbury. By the bye, that is almost enough to put one out of conceit\nwith a niece. Heaven forbid! at least, that I should ever bore people half so\nmuch about all the Knightleys together, as she does about Jane Fairfax. One is\nsick of the very name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter from her is read forty\ntimes over; her compliments to all friends go round and round again; and if she\ndoes but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher, or knit a pair of garters\nfor her grandmother, one hears of nothing else for a month. I wish Jane Fairfax\nvery well; but she tires me to death.”',
			'They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were superseded.\nEmma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor were as sure of\nrelief from her personal attention and kindness, her counsel and her patience,\nas from her purse. She understood their ways, could allow for their ignorance\nand their temptations, had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue\nfrom those for whom education had done so little; entered into their troubles\nwith ready sympathy, and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence\nas good-will. In the present instance, it was sickness and poverty together\nwhich she came to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give\ncomfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene\nas made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,',
			'“These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling they make\nevery thing else appear!—I feel now as if I could think of nothing but\nthese poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how soon it\nmay all vanish from my mind?”',
			'“Very true,” said Harriet. “Poor creatures! one can think of\nnothing else.”',
			'“And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,” said\nEmma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended the\nnarrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought them into the\nlane again. “I do not think it will,” stopping to look once more at\nall the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the still greater within.',
			'“Oh! dear, no,” said her companion.',
			'They walked on. The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend was passed, Mr.\nElton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give Emma time only to say\nfarther,',
			'“Ah! Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good\nthoughts. Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion has\nproduced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has done all that is truly\nimportant. If we feel for the wretched, enough to do all we can for them, the\nrest is empty sympathy, only distressing to ourselves.”',
			'Harriet could just answer, “Oh! dear, yes,” before the gentleman\njoined them. The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, were the\nfirst subject on meeting. He had been going to call on them. His visit he would\nnow defer; but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and\nshould be done. Mr. Elton then turned back to accompany them.',
			'“To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,” thought\nEmma; “to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase\nof love on each side. I should not wonder if it were to bring on the\ndeclaration. It must, if I were not here. I wish I were anywhere else.”',
			'Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon afterwards\ntook possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on one side of the lane,\nleaving them together in the main road. But she had not been there two minutes\nwhen she found that Harriet’s habits of dependence and imitation were\nbringing her up too, and that, in short, they would both be soon after her.\nThis would not do; she immediately stopped, under pretence of having some\nalteration to make in the lacing of her half-boot, and stooping down in\ncomplete occupation of the footpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk\non, and she would follow in half a minute. They did as they were desired; and\nby the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot, she had the\ncomfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken by a child from the\ncottage, setting out, according to orders, with her pitcher, to fetch broth\nfrom Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child, and talk to and question\nher, was the most natural thing in the world, or would have been the most\nnatural, had she been acting just then without design; and by this means the\nothers were still able to keep ahead, without any obligation of waiting for\nher. She gained on them, however, involuntarily: the child’s pace was\nquick, and theirs rather slow; and she was the more concerned at it, from their\nbeing evidently in a conversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking\nwith animation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,\nhaving sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw back a\nlittle more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged to join them.',
			'Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail; and Emma\nexperienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair\ncompanion an account of the yesterday’s party at his friend Cole’s,\nand that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese, the north Wiltshire,\nthe butter, the celery, the beet-root, and all the dessert.',
			'“This would soon have led to something better, of course,” was her\nconsoling reflection; “any thing interests between those who love; and\nany thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart. If I could but\nhave kept longer away!”',
			'They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage pales,\nwhen a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into the house, made her\nagain find something very much amiss about her boot, and fall behind to arrange\nit once more. She then broke the lace off short, and dexterously throwing it\ninto a ditch, was presently obliged to entreat them to stop, and acknowledged\nher inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in\ntolerable comfort.',
			'“Part of my lace is gone,” said she, “and I do not know how I\nam to contrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but I\nhope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to stop at\nyour house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string, or any\nthing just to keep my boot on.”',
			'Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing could exceed\nhis alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring\nto make every thing appear to advantage. The room they were taken into was the\none he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards; behind it was another with which\nit immediately communicated; the door between them was open, and Emma passed\ninto it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable\nmanner. She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it; but she fully\nintended that Mr. Elton should close it. It was not closed, however, it still\nremained ajar; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she\nhoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining\nroom. For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself. It could be\nprotracted no longer. She was then obliged to be finished, and make her\nappearance.',
			'The lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had a most\nfavourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory of having\nschemed successfully. But it would not do; he had not come to the point. He had\nbeen most agreeable, most delightful; he had told Harriet that he had seen them\ngo by, and had purposely followed them; other little gallantries and allusions\nhad been dropt, but nothing serious.',
			'“Cautious, very cautious,” thought Emma; “he advances inch by\ninch, and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.”',
			'Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious\ndevice, she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much\npresent enjoyment to both, and must be leading them forward to the great event.',
		],
		[
			'Mr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in Emma’s power\nto superintend his happiness or quicken his measures. The coming of her\nsister’s family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation, and\nthen in reality, it became henceforth her prime object of interest; and during\nthe ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expected—she did\nnot herself expect—that any thing beyond occasional, fortuitous\nassistance could be afforded by her to the lovers. They might advance rapidly\nif they would, however; they must advance somehow or other whether they would\nor no. She hardly wished to have more leisure for them. There are people, who\nthe more you do for them, the less they will do for themselves.',
			'Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual absent from\nSurry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest. Till this\nyear, every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between\nHartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given\nto sea-bathing for the children, and it was therefore many months since they\nhad been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions, or seen at all by Mr.\nWoodhouse, who could not be induced to get so far as London, even for poor\nIsabella’s sake; and who consequently was now most nervously and\napprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit.',
			'He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a little of the\nfatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the\nlast half of the way; but his alarms were needless; the sixteen miles being\nhappily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, their five children, and\na competent number of nursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety. The\nbustle and joy of such an arrival, the many to be talked to, welcomed,\nencouraged, and variously dispersed and disposed of, produced a noise and\nconfusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause, nor have\nendured much longer even for this; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings\nof her father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of\nmaternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones, and for\ntheir having instantly all the liberty and attendance, all the eating and\ndrinking, and sleeping and playing, which they could possibly wish for, without\nthe smallest delay, the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to\nhim, either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them.',
			'Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle, quiet\nmanners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate; wrapt up in her\nfamily; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so tenderly attached to her\nfather and sister that, but for these higher ties, a warmer love might have\nseemed impossible. She could never see a fault in any of them. She was not a\nwoman of strong understanding or any quickness; and with this resemblance of\nher father, she inherited also much of his constitution; was delicate in her\nown health, over-careful of that of her children, had many fears and many\nnerves, and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be\nof Mr. Perry. They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper, and a\nstrong habit of regard for every old acquaintance.',
			'Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man; rising in\nhis profession, domestic, and respectable in his private character; but with\nreserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing; and capable of\nbeing sometimes out of humour. He was not an ill-tempered man, not so often\nunreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his\ngreat perfection; and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife, it was hardly\npossible that any natural defects in it should not be increased. The extreme\nsweetness of her temper must hurt his. He had all the clearness and quickness\nof mind which she wanted, and he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a\nsevere thing.',
			'He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing wrong in him\nescaped her. She was quick in feeling the little injuries to Isabella, which\nIsabella never felt herself. Perhaps she might have passed over more had his\nmanners been flattering to Isabella’s sister, but they were only those of\na calmly kind brother and friend, without praise and without blindness; but\nhardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that\ngreatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of\nrespectful forbearance towards her father. There he had not always the patience\nthat could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse’s peculiarities and\nfidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp\nretort equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr. John Knightley\nhad really a great regard for his father-in-law, and generally a strong sense\nof what was due to him; but it was too often for Emma’s charity,\nespecially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured,\nthough the offence came not. The beginning, however, of every visit displayed\nnone but the properest feelings, and this being of necessity so short might be\nhoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality. They had not been long seated and\ncomposed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh,\ncalled his daughter’s attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she\nhad been there last.',
			'“Ah, my dear,” said he, “poor Miss Taylor—It is a\ngrievous business.”',
			'“Oh yes, sir,” cried she with ready sympathy, “how you must\nmiss her! And dear Emma, too!—What a dreadful loss to you both!—I\nhave been so grieved for you.—I could not imagine how you could possibly\ndo without her.—It is a sad change indeed.—But I hope she is pretty\nwell, sir.”',
			'“Pretty well, my dear—I hope—pretty well.—I do not know\nbut that the place agrees with her tolerably.”',
			'Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the\nair of Randalls.',
			'“Oh! no—none in the least. I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my\nlife—never looking so well. Papa is only speaking his own regret.”',
			'“Very much to the honour of both,” was the handsome reply.',
			'“And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?” asked Isabella in the\nplaintive tone which just suited her father.',
			'Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.—“Not near so often, my dear, as I could\nwish.”',
			'“Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they\nmarried. Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one, have we\nseen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both, either at Randalls\nor here—and as you may suppose, Isabella, most frequently here. They are\nvery, very kind in their visits. Mr. Weston is really as kind as herself. Papa,\nif you speak in that melancholy way, you will be giving Isabella a false idea\nof us all. Every body must be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every\nbody ought also to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our\nmissing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated—which is\nthe exact truth.”',
			'“Just as it should be,” said Mr. John Knightley, “and just as\nI hoped it was from your letters. Her wish of shewing you attention could not\nbe doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy. I have\nbeen always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of the change being so\nvery material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and now you have Emma’s\naccount, I hope you will be satisfied.”',
			'“Why, to be sure,” said Mr. Woodhouse—“yes,\ncertainly—I cannot deny that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and\nsee us pretty often—but then—she is always obliged to go away\nagain.”',
			'“It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.—You\nquite forget poor Mr. Weston.”',
			'“I think, indeed,” said John Knightley pleasantly, “that Mr.\nWeston has some little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of\nthe poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the claims of\nthe man may very likely strike us with equal force. As for Isabella, she has\nbeen married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr. Westons\naside as much as she can.”',
			'“Me, my love,” cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in\npart.— “Are you talking about me?—I am sure nobody ought to\nbe, or can be, a greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not\nbeen for the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of\nMiss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to slighting\nMr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is nothing he does not\ndeserve. I believe he is one of the very best-tempered men that ever existed.\nExcepting yourself and your brother, I do not know his equal for temper. I\nshall never forget his flying Henry’s kite for him that very windy day\nlast Easter—and ever since his particular kindness last September\ntwelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o’clock at night, on purpose\nto assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced\nthere could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.—If\nany body can deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor.”',
			'“Where is the young man?” said John Knightley. “Has he been\nhere on this occasion—or has he not?”',
			'“He has not been here yet,” replied Emma. “There was a strong\nexpectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in nothing; and\nI have not heard him mentioned lately.”',
			'“But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,” said her father.\n“He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a very\nproper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to me. I thought it very well\ndone of him indeed. Whether it was his own idea you know, one cannot tell. He\nis but young, and his uncle, perhaps—”',
			'“My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.”',
			'“Three-and-twenty!—is he indeed?—Well, I could not have\nthought it—and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother!\nWell, time does fly indeed!—and my memory is very bad. However, it was an\nexceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal of\npleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept.\n28th—and began, ‘My dear Madam,’ but I forget how it went on;\nand it was signed ‘F. C. Weston Churchill.’—I remember that\nperfectly.”',
			'“How very pleasing and proper of him!” cried the good-hearted Mrs.\nJohn Knightley. “I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man.\nBut how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father! There is\nsomething so shocking in a child’s being taken away from his parents and\nnatural home! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part with him. To\ngive up one’s child! I really never could think well of any body who\nproposed such a thing to any body else.”',
			'“Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,” observed\nMr. John Knightley coolly. “But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have\nfelt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mr. Weston is rather an\neasy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings; he takes things as\nhe finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other, depending, I\nsuspect, much more upon what is called society for his comforts, that is, upon\nthe power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with his neighbours five\ntimes a week, than upon family affection, or any thing that home\naffords.”',
			'Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, and had half a\nmind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it pass. She would keep the\npeace if possible; and there was something honourable and valuable in the\nstrong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of home to himself, whence resulted\nher brother’s disposition to look down on the common rate of social\nintercourse, and those to whom it was important.—It had a high claim to\nforbearance.',
		],
		[
			'Mr. Knightley was to dine with them—rather against the inclination of Mr.\nWoodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him in\nIsabella’s first day. Emma’s sense of right however had decided it;\nand besides the consideration of what was due to each brother, she had\nparticular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr.\nKnightley and herself, in procuring him the proper invitation.',
			'She hoped they might now become friends again. She thought it was time to make\nup. Making-up indeed would not do. She certainly had not been in the\nwrong, and he would never own that he had. Concession must be out of the\nquestion; but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled;\nand she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship, that when\nhe came into the room she had one of the children with her—the youngest,\na nice little girl about eight months old, who was now making her first visit\nto Hartfield, and very happy to be danced about in her aunt’s arms. It\ndid assist; for though he began with grave looks and short questions, he was\nsoon led on to talk of them all in the usual way, and to take the child out of\nher arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity. Emma felt they were\nfriends again; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction, and\nthen a little sauciness, she could not help saying, as he was admiring the\nbaby,',
			'“What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and nieces.\nAs to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different; but with regard\nto these children, I observe we never disagree.”',
			'“If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women,\nand as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them, as\nyou are where these children are concerned, we might always think alike.”',
			'“To be sure—our discordancies must always arise from my being in\nthe wrong.”',
			'“Yes,” said he, smiling—“and reason good. I was sixteen\nyears old when you were born.”',
			'“A material difference then,” she replied—“and no doubt\nyou were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does not\nthe lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good deal\nnearer?”',
			'“Yes—a good deal nearer.”',
			'“But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right, if we\nthink differently.”',
			'“I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years’ experience,\nand by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. Come, my dear Emma,\nlet us be friends, and say no more about it. Tell your aunt, little Emma, that\nshe ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances, and\nthat if she were not wrong before, she is now.”',
			'“That’s true,” she cried—“very true. Little Emma,\ngrow up a better woman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and not half so\nconceited. Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done. As far as\ngood intentions went, we were both right, and I must say that no effects\non my side of the argument have yet proved wrong. I only want to know that Mr.\nMartin is not very, very bitterly disappointed.”',
			'“A man cannot be more so,” was his short, full answer.',
			'“Ah!—Indeed I am very sorry.—Come, shake hands with\nme.”',
			'This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John Knightley made\nhis appearance, and “How d’ye do, George?” and “John,\nhow are you?” succeeded in the true English style, burying under a\ncalmness that seemed all but indifference, the real attachment which would have\nled either of them, if requisite, to do every thing for the good of the other.',
			'The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards entirely\nfor the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella, and the little party\nmade two natural divisions; on one side he and his daughter; on the other the\ntwo Mr. Knightleys; their subjects totally distinct, or very rarely\nmixing—and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other.',
			'The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally of\nthose of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative, and who\nwas always the greater talker. As a magistrate, he had generally some point of\nlaw to consult John about, or, at least, some curious anecdote to give; and as\na farmer, as keeping in hand the home-farm at Donwell, he had to tell what\nevery field was to bear next year, and to give all such local information as\ncould not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been\nthe longest part of his life, and whose attachments were strong. The plan of a\ndrain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree, and the destination of\nevery acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn, was entered into with as much\nequality of interest by John, as his cooler manners rendered possible; and if\nhis willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about, his inquiries\neven approached a tone of eagerness.',
			'While they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying a full\nflow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.',
			'“My poor dear Isabella,” said he, fondly taking her hand, and\ninterrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one of her five\nchildren—“How long it is, how terribly long since you were here!\nAnd how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to bed early, my\ndear—and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.—You and I\nwill have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear Emma, suppose we all have a\nlittle gruel.”',
			'Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did, that both the Mr.\nKnightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself;—and two\nbasins only were ordered. After a little more discourse in praise of gruel,\nwith some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body, he\nproceeded to say, with an air of grave reflection,',
			'“It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn at South\nEnd instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of the sea air.”',
			'“Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir—or we should\nnot have gone. He recommended it for all the children, but particularly for the\nweakness in little Bella’s throat,—both sea air and bathing.”',
			'“Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good;\nand as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, though perhaps I never\ntold you so before, that the sea is very rarely of use to any body. I am sure\nit almost killed me once.”',
			'“Come, come,” cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject,\n“I must beg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious and\nmiserable;—I who have never seen it! South End is prohibited, if you\nplease. My dear Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry\nyet; and he never forgets you.”',
			'“Oh! good Mr. Perry—how is he, sir?”',
			'“Why, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor Perry is bilious, and he has\nnot time to take care of himself—he tells me he has not time to take care\nof himself—which is very sad—but he is always wanted all round the\ncountry. I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere. But then there\nis not so clever a man any where.”',
			'“And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow? I\nhave a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he will be calling soon. He will be\nso pleased to see my little ones.”',
			'“I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask\nhim about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever he comes, you had\nbetter let him look at little Bella’s throat.”',
			'“Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly any\nuneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatest service to her, or\nelse it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr.\nWingfield’s, which we have been applying at times ever since\nAugust.”',
			'“It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of use to\nher—and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I would have\nspoken to—',
			'“You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,” said Emma,\n“I have not heard one inquiry after them.”',
			'“Oh! the good Bateses—I am quite ashamed of myself—but you\nmention them in most of your letters. I hope they are quite well. Good old Mrs.\nBates—I will call upon her to-morrow, and take my children.—They\nare always so pleased to see my children.—And that excellent Miss\nBates!—such thorough worthy people!—How are they, sir?”',
			'“Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. Bates had a bad\ncold about a month ago.”',
			'“How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this\nautumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or\nheavy—except when it has been quite an influenza.”',
			'“That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree you\nmention. Perry says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy as he\nhas very often known them in November. Perry does not call it altogether a\nsickly season.”',
			'“No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it very sickly\nexcept—',
			'“Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always a\nsickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. It is a dreadful\nthing to have you forced to live there! so far off!—and the air so\nbad!”',
			'“No, indeed—we are not at all in a bad air. Our part of\nLondon is very superior to most others!—You must not confound us with\nLondon in general, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very\ndifferent from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! I should be unwilling,\nI own, to live in any other part of the town;—there is hardly any other\nthat I could be satisfied to have my children in: but we are so\nremarkably airy!—Mr. Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square\ndecidedly the most favourable as to air.”',
			'“Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of it—but\nafter you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you different\ncreatures; you do not look like the same. Now I cannot say, that I think you\nare any of you looking well at present.”',
			'“I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those\nlittle nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely free from\nanywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were rather pale before\nthey went to bed, it was only because they were a little more tired than usual,\nfrom their journey and the happiness of coming. I hope you will think better of\ntheir looks to-morrow; for I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not\nbelieve he had ever sent us off altogether, in such good case. I trust, at\nleast, that you do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,” turning her eyes\nwith affectionate anxiety towards her husband.',
			'“Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John Knightley\nvery far from looking well.”',
			'“What is the matter, sir?—Did you speak to me?” cried Mr.\nJohn Knightley, hearing his own name.',
			'“I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you looking\nwell—but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could have\nwished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before you left\nhome.”',
			'“My dear Isabella,”—exclaimed he hastily—“pray do\nnot concern yourself about my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling\nyourself and the children, and let me look as I chuse.”',
			'“I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your\nbrother,” cried Emma, “about your friend Mr. Graham’s\nintending to have a bailiff from Scotland, to look after his new estate. What\nwill it answer? Will not the old prejudice be too strong?”',
			'And she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced to give\nher attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing worse to hear\nthan Isabella’s kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax; and Jane Fairfax, though\nno great favourite with her in general, she was at that moment very happy to\nassist in praising.',
			'“That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!” said Mrs. John\nKnightley.—“It is so long since I have seen her, except now and\nthen for a moment accidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her good\nold grandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! I always\nregret excessively on dear Emma’s account that she cannot be more at\nHighbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs.\nCampbell will not be able to part with her at all. She would be such a\ndelightful companion for Emma.”',
			'Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,',
			'“Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another pretty\nkind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not have a better\ncompanion than Harriet.”',
			'“I am most happy to hear it—but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be\nso very accomplished and superior!—and exactly Emma’s age.”',
			'This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar moment,\nand passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not close without a\nlittle return of agitation. The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be\nsaid—much praise and many comments—undoubting decision of its\nwholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty severe Philippics upon the\nmany houses where it was never met with tolerably;—but, unfortunately,\namong the failures which the daughter had to instance, the most recent, and\ntherefore most prominent, was in her own cook at South End, a young woman hired\nfor the time, who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin\nof nice smooth gruel, thin, but not too thin. Often as she had wished for and\nordered it, she had never been able to get any thing tolerable. Here was a\ndangerous opening.',
			'“Ah!” said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on\nher with tender concern.—The ejaculation in Emma’s ear expressed,\n“Ah! there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End.\nIt does not bear talking of.” And for a little while she hoped he would\nnot talk of it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to\nthe relish of his own smooth gruel. After an interval of some minutes, however,\nhe began with,',
			'“I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn,\ninstead of coming here.”',
			'“But why should you be sorry, sir?—I assure you, it did the\nchildren a great deal of good.”',
			'“And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have been to\nSouth End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was surprized to hear you had\nfixed upon South End.”',
			'“I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is quite a\nmistake, sir.—We all had our health perfectly well there, never found the\nleast inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield says it is entirely a\nmistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I am sure he may be depended on,\nfor he thoroughly understands the nature of the air, and his own brother and\nfamily have been there repeatedly.”',
			'“You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went\nanywhere.—Perry was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best\nof all the sea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air.\nAnd, by what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from\nthe sea—a quarter of a mile off—very comfortable. You should have\nconsulted Perry.”',
			'“But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;—only consider how\ngreat it would have been.—An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of\nforty.”',
			'“Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else\nshould be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to chuse\nbetween forty miles and an hundred.—Better not move at all, better stay\nin London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air. This is\njust what Perry said. It seemed to him a very ill-judged measure.”',
			'Emma’s attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he had reached\nsuch a point as this, she could not wonder at her brother-in-law’s\nbreaking out.',
			'“Mr. Perry,” said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure,\n“would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why does he\nmake it any business of his, to wonder at what I do?—at my taking my\nfamily to one part of the coast or another?—I may be allowed, I hope, the\nuse of my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.—I want his directions no more\nthan his drugs.” He paused—and growing cooler in a moment, added,\nwith only sarcastic dryness, “If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a\nwife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no\ngreater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as\nwilling to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself.”',
			'“True, true,” cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready\ninterposition—“very true. That’s a consideration\nindeed.—But John, as to what I was telling you of my idea of moving the\npath to Langham, of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through\nthe home meadows, I cannot conceive any difficulty. I should not attempt it, if\nit were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people, but if you\ncall to mind exactly the present line of the path.... The only way of proving\nit, however, will be to turn to our maps. I shall see you at the Abbey\nto-morrow morning I hope, and then we will look them over, and you shall give\nme your opinion.”',
			'Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend\nPerry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously, been attributing many of\nhis own feelings and expressions;—but the soothing attentions of his\ndaughters gradually removed the present evil, and the immediate alertness of\none brother, and better recollections of the other, prevented any renewal of\nit.',

			'There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John Knightley,\nin this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning among her old\nacquaintance with her five children, and talking over what she had done every\nevening with her father and sister. She had nothing to wish otherwise, but that\nthe days did not pass so swiftly. It was a delightful visit;—perfect, in\nbeing much too short.',
			'In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings;\nbut one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too, there was no\navoiding, though at Christmas. Mr. Weston would take no denial; they must all\ndine at Randalls one day;—even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a\npossible thing in preference to a division of the party.',
			'How they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if he could,\nbut as his son and daughter’s carriage and horses were actually at\nHartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head; it\nhardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that\nthey might in one of the carriages find room for Harriet also.',
			'Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, were the only\npersons invited to meet them;—the hours were to be early, as well as the\nnumbers few; Mr. Woodhouse’s habits and inclination being consulted in\nevery thing.',
			'The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event that Mr.\nWoodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been spent by Harriet\nat Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold, that, but\nfor her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs. Goddard, Emma could not have\nallowed her to leave the house. Emma called on her the next day, and found her\ndoom already signed with regard to Randalls. She was very feverish and had a\nbad sore throat: Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was\ntalked of, and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority\nwhich excluded her from this delightful engagement, though she could not speak\nof her loss without many tears.',
			'Emma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard’s\nunavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr.\nElton’s would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her at last\ntolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless\nvisit, and of their all missing her very much. She had not advanced many yards\nfrom Mrs. Goddard’s door, when she was met by Mr. Elton himself,\nevidently coming towards it, and as they walked on slowly together in\nconversation about the invalid—of whom he, on the rumour of considerable\nillness, had been going to inquire, that he might carry some report of her to\nHartfield—they were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the\ndaily visit to Donwell, with his two eldest boys, whose healthy, glowing faces\nshewed all the benefit of a country run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch\nof the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for. They joined\ncompany and proceeded together. Emma was just describing the nature of her\nfriend’s complaint;—“a throat very much inflamed, with a\ngreat deal of heat about her, a quick, low pulse, &c. and she was sorry to\nfind from Mrs. Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and\nhad often alarmed her with them.” Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the\noccasion, as he exclaimed,',
			'“A sore-throat!—I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid\ninfectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care of yourself as\nwell as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks. Why does not Perry\nsee her?”',
			'Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this excess\nof apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard’s experience and care; but\nas there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to\nreason away, which she would rather feed and assist than not, she added soon\nafterwards—as if quite another subject,',
			'“It is so cold, so very cold—and looks and feels so very much like\nsnow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I should\nreally try not to go out to-day—and dissuade my father from venturing;\nbut as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel the cold himself, I\ndo not like to interfere, as I know it would be so great a disappointment to\nMr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr. Elton, in your case, I should\ncertainly excuse myself. You appear to me a little hoarse already, and when you\nconsider what demand of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think\nit would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of\nyourself to-night.”',
			'Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make; which was\nexactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a\nfair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her’s, he had not\nreally the least inclination to give up the visit;—but Emma, too eager\nand busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially, or\nsee him with clear vision, was very well satisfied with his muttering\nacknowledgment of its being “very cold, certainly very cold,” and\nwalked on, rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls, and secured him\nthe power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening.',
			'“You do quite right,” said she;—“we will make your\napologies to Mr. and Mrs. Weston.”',
			'But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly offering a\nseat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton’s only objection, and\nMr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction. It was a\ndone thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never had his broad handsome face\nexpressed more pleasure than at this moment; never had his smile been stronger,\nnor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her.',
			'“Well,” said she to herself, “this is most\nstrange!—After I had got him off so well, to chuse to go into company,\nand leave Harriet ill behind!—Most strange indeed!—But there is, I\nbelieve, in many men, especially single men, such an inclination—such a\npassion for dining out—a dinner engagement is so high in the class of\ntheir pleasures, their employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that\nany thing gives way to it—and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a\nmost valuable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in love\nwith Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he must dine out\nwherever he is asked. What a strange thing love is! he can see ready wit in\nHarriet, but will not dine alone for her.”',
			'Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him the\njustice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of\nnaming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he\nshould call at Mrs. Goddard’s for news of her fair friend, the last thing\nbefore he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again, when he hoped to be\nable to give a better report; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way\nthat left the balance of approbation much in his favour.',
			'After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley began\nwith—',
			'“I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr.\nElton. It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned. With men he\ncan be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to please, every feature\nworks.”',
			'“Mr. Elton’s manners are not perfect,” replied Emma;\n“but where there is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does\noverlook a great deal. Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he\nwill have the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such perfect\ngood-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but value.”',
			'“Yes,” said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness,\n“he seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you.”',
			'“Me!” she replied with a smile of astonishment, “are you\nimagining me to be Mr. Elton’s object?”',
			'“Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never\noccurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.”',
			'“Mr. Elton in love with me!—What an idea!”',
			'“I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it is so\nor not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your manners to him\nencouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had better look about you, and\nascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.”',
			'“I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton and I\nare very good friends, and nothing more;” and she walked on, amusing\nherself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial\nknowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to\njudgment are for ever falling into; and not very well pleased with her brother\nfor imagining her blind and ignorant, and in want of counsel. He said no more.',
			'Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that in spite of\nthe increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it, and\nset forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own\ncarriage, with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the\nothers; too full of the wonder of his own going, and the pleasure it was to\nafford at Randalls to see that it was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it.\nThe cold, however, was severe; and by the time the second carriage was in\nmotion, a few flakes of snow were finding their way down, and the sky had the\nappearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a\nvery white world in a very short time.',
			'Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. The preparing\nand the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of his children after\ndinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least, which Mr. John Knightley did\nnot by any means like; he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all\nworth the purchase; and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by\nhim in expressing his discontent.',
			'“A man,” said he, “must have a very good opinion of himself\nwhen he asks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as\nthis, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think himself a most agreeable\nfellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatest\nabsurdity—Actually snowing at this moment!—The folly of not\nallowing people to be comfortable at home—and the folly of people’s\nnot staying comfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out\nsuch an evening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we\nshould deem it;—and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing\nthan usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of the\nvoice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his view or his\nfeelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter that he\ncan;—here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another\nman’s house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard\nyesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow. Going in dismal\nweather, to return probably in worse;—four horses and four servants taken\nout for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering creatures into colder rooms\nand worse company than they might have had at home.”',
			'Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no doubt he\nwas in the habit of receiving, to emulate the “Very true, my love,”\nwhich must have been usually administered by his travelling companion; but she\nhad resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all. She could not\nbe complying, she dreaded being quarrelsome; her heroism reached only to\nsilence. She allowed him to talk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself\nup, without opening her lips.',
			'They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr. Elton,\nspruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. Emma thought with pleasure\nof some change of subject. Mr. Elton was all obligation and cheerfulness; he\nwas so very cheerful in his civilities indeed, that she began to think he must\nhave received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her. She had\nsent while dressing, and the answer had been, “Much the same—not\nbetter.”',
			'“My report from Mrs. Goddard’s,” said she presently,\n“was not so pleasant as I had hoped—‘Not better’ was\nmy answer.”',
			'His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he\nanswered.',
			'“Oh! no—I am grieved to find—I was on the point of telling\nyou that when I called at Mrs. Goddard’s door, which I did the very last\nthing before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better, by\nno means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and concerned—I had\nflattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew had\nbeen given her in the morning.”',
			'Emma smiled and answered—“My visit was of use to the nervous part\nof her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat; it is a\nmost severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her, as you probably\nheard.”',
			'“Yes—I imagined—that is—I did not—”',
			'“He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow\nmorning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is impossible not\nto feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party to-day!”',
			'“Dreadful!—Exactly so, indeed.—She will be missed every\nmoment.”',
			'This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable; but\nit should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute\nafterwards he began to speak of other things, and in a voice of the greatest\nalacrity and enjoyment.',
			'“What an excellent device,” said he, “the use of a sheepskin\nfor carriages. How very comfortable they make it;—impossible to feel cold\nwith such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a\ngentleman’s carriage perfectly complete. One is so fenced and guarded\nfrom the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted.\nWeather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a very cold\nafternoon—but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.—Ha!\nsnows a little I see.”',
			'“Yes,” said John Knightley, “and I think we shall have a good\ndeal of it.”',
			'“Christmas weather,” observed Mr. Elton. “Quite seasonable;\nand extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday,\nand prevent this day’s party, which it might very possibly have done, for\nMr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the\nground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite the season indeed for\nfriendly meetings. At Christmas every body invites their friends about them,\nand people think little of even the worst weather. I was snowed up at a\nfriend’s house once for a week. Nothing could be pleasanter. I went for\nonly one night, and could not get away till that very day\nse’nnight.”',
			'Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but said\nonly, coolly,',
			'“I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.”',
			'At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too much astonished\nnow at Mr. Elton’s spirits for other feelings. Harriet seemed quite\nforgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.',
			'“We are sure of excellent fires,” continued he, “and every\nthing in the greatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;—Mrs.\nWeston indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, so\nhospitable, and so fond of society;—it will be a small party, but where\nsmall parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any. Mr.\nWeston’s dining-room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably; and\nfor my part, I would rather, under such circumstances, fall short by two than\nexceed by two. I think you will agree with me, (turning with a soft air to\nEmma,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation, though Mr. Knightley\nperhaps, from being used to the large parties of London, may not quite enter\ninto our feelings.”',
			'“I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir—I never dine\nwith any body.”',
			'“Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the law had\nbeen so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come when you will be paid\nfor all this, when you will have little labour and great enjoyment.”',
			'“My first enjoyment,” replied John Knightley, as they passed\nthrough the sweep-gate, “will be to find myself safe at Hartfield\nagain.”',
		],
		[
			'Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into\nMrs. Weston’s drawing-room;—Mr. Elton must compose his joyous\nlooks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour. Mr. Elton must smile\nless, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for the place.—Emma only\nmight be as nature prompted, and shew herself just as happy as she was. To her\nit was real enjoyment to be with the Westons. Mr. Weston was a great favourite,\nand there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such\nunreserve, as to his wife; not any one, to whom she related with such\nconviction of being listened to and understood, of being always interesting and\nalways intelligible, the little affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and\npleasures of her father and herself. She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in\nwhich Mrs. Weston had not a lively concern; and half an hour’s\nuninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily\nhappiness of private life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.',
			'This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day’s visit might not afford,\nwhich certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but the very sight of\nMrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was grateful to Emma, and she\ndetermined to think as little as possible of Mr. Elton’s oddities, or of\nany thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost.',
			'The misfortune of Harriet’s cold had been pretty well gone through before\nher arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the\nhistory of it, besides all the history of his own and Isabella’s coming,\nand of Emma’s being to follow, and had indeed just got to the end of his\nsatisfaction that James should come and see his daughter, when the others\nappeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been almost wholly engrossed by her\nattentions to him, was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma.',
			'Emma’s project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather sorry\nto find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close to her. The\ndifficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet, from\nher mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but was continually obtruding his\nhappy countenance on her notice, and solicitously addressing her upon every\noccasion. Instead of forgetting him, his behaviour was such that she could not\navoid the internal suggestion of “Can it really be as my brother\nimagined? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his\naffections from Harriet to me?—Absurd and insufferable!”—Yet\nhe would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm, would be so interested\nabout her father, and so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin\nadmiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed\nterribly like a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve\nher good manners. For her own sake she could not be rude; and for\nHarriet’s, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even\npositively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was going on\namongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton’s\nnonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to. She heard enough to know\nthat Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son; she heard the words\n“my son,” and “Frank,” and “my son,”\nrepeated several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much\nsuspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son; but before she\ncould quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely past that any reviving\nquestion from her would have been awkward.',
			'Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma’s resolution of never marrying,\nthere was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill, which\nalways interested her. She had frequently thought—especially since his\nfather’s marriage with Miss Taylor—that if she were to\nmarry, he was the very person to suit her in age, character and condition. He\nseemed by this connexion between the families, quite to belong to her. She\ncould not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think\nof. That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded;\nand though not meaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a\nsituation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change\nit for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided intention of finding\nhim pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain degree, and a sort of pleasure\nin the idea of their being coupled in their friends’ imaginations.',
			'With such sensations, Mr. Elton’s civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;\nbut she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very\ncross—and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass\nwithout bringing forward the same information again, or the substance of it,\nfrom the open-hearted Mr. Weston.—So it proved;—for when happily\nreleased from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston, at dinner, he made use of\nthe very first interval in the cares of hospitality, the very first leisure\nfrom the saddle of mutton, to say to her,',
			'“We want only two more to be just the right number. I should like to see\ntwo more here,—your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my\nson—and then I should say we were quite complete. I believe you did not\nhear me telling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting Frank. I\nhad a letter from him this morning, and he will be with us within a\nfortnight.”',
			'Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to his\nproposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party quite\ncomplete.',
			'“He has been wanting to come to us,” continued Mr. Weston,\n“ever since September: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot\ncommand his own time. He has those to please who must be pleased, and who\n(between ourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.\nBut now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in\nJanuary.”',
			'“What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is so\nanxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy as\nyourself.”',
			'“Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another put-off.\nShe does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but she does not know the\nparties so well as I do. The case, you see, is—(but this is quite between\nourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room. There are\nsecrets in all families, you know)—The case is, that a party of friends\nare invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January; and that Frank’s\ncoming depends upon their being put off. If they are not put off, he cannot\nstir. But I know they will, because it is a family that a certain lady, of some\nconsequence, at Enscombe, has a particular dislike to: and though it is thought\nnecessary to invite them once in two or three years, they always are put off\nwhen it comes to the point. I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as\nconfident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of being\nhere myself: but your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the\ntable) has so few vagaries herself, and has been so little used to them at\nHartfield, that she cannot calculate on their effects, as I have been long in\nthe practice of doing.”',
			'“I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,”\nreplied Emma; “but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If you think\nhe will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.”',
			'“Yes—I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been\nat the place in my life.—She is an odd woman!—But I never allow\nmyself to speak ill of her, on Frank’s account; for I do believe her to\nbe very fond of him. I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any\nbody, except herself: but she has always been kind to him (in her\nway—allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thing to\nbe as she likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him, that he\nshould excite such an affection; for, though I would not say it to any body\nelse, she has no more heart than a stone to people in general; and the devil of\na temper.”',
			'Emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston, very\nsoon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy—yet\nobserving, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.— Mrs.\nWeston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very glad to be secure of\nundergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of: “for I\ncannot depend upon his coming. I cannot be so sanguine as Mr. Weston. I am very\nmuch afraid that it will all end in nothing. Mr. Weston, I dare say, has been\ntelling you exactly how the matter stands?”',
			'“Yes—it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs.\nChurchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world.”',
			'“My Emma!” replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, “what is the\ncertainty of caprice?” Then turning to Isabella, who had not been\nattending before—“You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we\nare by no means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his\nfather thinks. It depends entirely upon his aunt’s spirits and pleasure;\nin short, upon her temper. To you—to my two daughters—I may venture\non the truth. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered\nwoman; and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare him.”',
			'“Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,” replied\nIsabella: “and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the\ngreatest compassion. To be constantly living with an ill-tempered person, must\nbe dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any thing of; but it must\nbe a life of misery. What a blessing, that she never had any children! Poor\nlittle creatures, how unhappy she would have made them!”',
			'Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston. She should then have heard\nmore: Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve which she\nwould not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed, would scarcely try to\nconceal any thing relative to the Churchills from her, excepting those views on\nthe young man, of which her own imagination had already given her such\ninstinctive knowledge. But at present there was nothing more to be said. Mr.\nWoodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long\nafter dinner, was a confinement that he could not endure. Neither wine nor\nconversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those with whom he\nwas always comfortable.',
			'While he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of saying,',
			'“And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means\ncertain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant, whenever it\ntakes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.”',
			'“Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. Even\nif this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that some\nexcuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear to imagine any\nreluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish on the\nChurchills’ to keep him to themselves. There is jealousy. They are\njealous even of his regard for his father. In short, I can feel no dependence\non his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine.”',
			'“He ought to come,” said Emma. “If he could stay only a\ncouple of days, he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young\nman’s not having it in his power to do as much as that. A young\nwoman, if she fall into bad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance\nfrom those she wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young\nman’s being under such restraint, as not to be able to spend a\nweek with his father, if he likes it.”',
			'“One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before one\ndecides upon what he can do,” replied Mrs. Weston. “One ought to\nuse the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one individual\nof any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must not be judged by\ngeneral rules: she is so very unreasonable; and every thing gives way to\nher.”',
			'“But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite. Now,\naccording to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural, that while\nshe makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to whom she owes every\nthing, while she exercises incessant caprice towards him, she should\nfrequently be governed by the nephew, to whom she owes nothing at all.”',
			'“My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand a\nbad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go its own way. I have no\ndoubt of his having, at times, considerable influence; but it may be perfectly\nimpossible for him to know beforehand when it will be.”',
			'Emma listened, and then coolly said, “I shall not be satisfied, unless he\ncomes.”',
			'“He may have a great deal of influence on some points,” continued\nMrs. Weston, “and on others, very little: and among those, on which she\nis beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance of his\ncoming away from them to visit us.”',

		[
			'Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his tea he was\nquite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three companions could do, to\nentertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour, before the other\ngentlemen appeared. Mr. Weston was chatty and convivial, and no friend to early\nseparations of any sort; but at last the drawing-room party did receive an\naugmentation. Mr. Elton, in very good spirits, was one of the first to walk in.\nMrs. Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa. He joined them\nimmediately, and, with scarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.',
			'Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind by the\nexpectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his late\nimproprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on his making\nHarriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with most friendly smiles.',
			'He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend—her fair,\nlovely, amiable friend. “Did she know?—had she heard any thing\nabout her, since their being at Randalls?—he felt much anxiety—he\nmust confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably.”\nAnd in this style he talked on for some time very properly, not much attending\nto any answer, but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore\nthroat; and Emma was quite in charity with him.',
			'But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if he were\nmore afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account, than on\nHarriet’s—more anxious that she should escape the infection, than\nthat there should be no infection in the complaint. He began with great\nearnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber again, for\nthe present—to entreat her to promise him not to venture\ninto such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion; and though\nshe tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course,\nthere was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her. She was vexed.\nIt did appear—there was no concealing it—exactly like the pretence\nof being in love with her, instead of Harriet; an inconstancy, if real, the\nmost contemptible and abominable! and she had difficulty in behaving with\ntemper. He turned to Mrs. Weston to implore her assistance, “Would not\nshe give him her support?—would not she add her persuasions to his, to\ninduce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard’s till it were certain\nthat Miss Smith’s disorder had no infection? He could not be satisfied\nwithout a promise—would not she give him her influence in procuring\nit?”',
			'“So scrupulous for others,” he continued, “and yet so\ncareless for herself! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day,\nand yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore\nthroat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?—Judge between us. Have not I\nsome right to complain? I am sure of your kind support and aid.”',
			'Emma saw Mrs. Weston’s surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an\naddress which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right of first\ninterest in her; and as for herself, she was too much provoked and offended to\nhave the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose. She could only give\nhim a look; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his\nsenses, and then left the sofa, removing to a seat by her sister, and giving\nher all her attention.',
			'She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly did another\nsubject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room from examining\nthe weather, and opened on them all with the information of the ground being\ncovered with snow, and of its still snowing fast, with a strong drifting wind;\nconcluding with these words to Mr. Woodhouse:',
			'“This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements, sir.\nSomething new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a\nstorm of snow.”',
			'Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else had\nsomething to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized, and had\nsome question to ask, or some comfort to offer. Mrs. Weston and Emma tried\nearnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son-in-law, who was\npursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.',
			'“I admired your resolution very much, sir,” said he, “in\nventuring out in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very\nsoon. Every body must have seen the snow coming on. I admired your spirit; and\nI dare say we shall get home very well. Another hour or two’s snow can\nhardly make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one is blown over\nin the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand. I dare\nsay we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight.”',
			'Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he had known\nit to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest it should make Mr.\nWoodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his hurrying away. As to there\nbeing any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return,\nthat was a mere joke; he was afraid they would find no difficulty. He wished\nthe road might be impassable, that he might be able to keep them all at\nRandalls; and with the utmost good-will was sure that accommodation might be\nfound for every body, calling on his wife to agree with him, that with a little\ncontrivance, every body might be lodged, which she hardly knew how to do, from\nthe consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.',
			'“What is to be done, my dear Emma?—what is to be done?” was\nMr. Woodhouse’s first exclamation, and all that he could say for some\ntime. To her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, her\nrepresentation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and of their\nhaving so many friends about them, revived him a little.',
			'His eldest daughter’s alarm was equal to his own. The horror of being\nblocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, was full in her\nimagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous\npeople, but in a state that admitted no delay, she was eager to have it\nsettled, that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls, while she and her\nhusband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted\nsnow that might impede them.',
			'“You had better order the carriage directly, my love,” said she;\n“I dare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if\nwe do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I am not at all\nafraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change my shoes, you\nknow, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing that gives me\ncold.”',
			'“Indeed!” replied he. “Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most\nextraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing does give\nyou cold. Walk home!—you are prettily shod for walking home, I dare say.\nIt will be bad enough for the horses.”',
			'Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan. Mrs. Weston\ncould only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma could not so entirely\ngive up the hope of their being all able to get away; and they were still\ndiscussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who had left the room immediately\nafter his brother’s first report of the snow, came back again, and told\nthem that he had been out of doors to examine, and could answer for there not\nbeing the smallest difficulty in their getting home, whenever they liked it,\neither now or an hour hence. He had gone beyond the sweep—some way along\nthe Highbury road—the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep—in\nmany places hardly enough to whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling\nat present, but the clouds were parting, and there was every appearance of its\nbeing soon over. He had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with him in\nthere being nothing to apprehend.',
			'To Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they were scarcely\nless acceptable to Emma on her father’s account, who was immediately set\nas much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed; but the\nalarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort\nfor him while he continued at Randalls. He was satisfied of there being no\npresent danger in returning home, but no assurances could convince him that it\nwas safe to stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending,\nMr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus—',
			'“Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?”',
			'“I am ready, if the others are.”',
			'“Shall I ring the bell?”',
			'“Yes, do.”',
			'And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. A few minutes more, and\nEmma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house, to get\nsober and cool, and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit\nof hardship were over.',
			'The carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on such\noccasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr. Weston;\nbut not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the\nsight of the snow which had actually fallen, and the discovery of a much darker\nnight than he had been prepared for. “He was afraid they should have a\nvery bad drive. He was afraid poor Isabella would not like it. And there would\nbe poor Emma in the carriage behind. He did not know what they had best do.\nThey must keep as much together as they could;” and James was talked to,\nand given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage.',
			'Isabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that he did not\nbelong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally; so that Emma\nfound, on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr. Elton,\nthat the door was to be lawfully shut on them, and that they were to have a\ntête-à-tête drive. It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment, it would\nhave been rather a pleasure, previous to the suspicions of this very day; she\ncould have talked to him of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would\nhave seemed but one. But now, she would rather it had not happened. She\nbelieved he had been drinking too much of Mr. Weston’s good wine, and\nfelt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense.',
			'To restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was immediately\npreparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the\nnight; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had they passed the sweep-gate and\njoined the other carriage, than she found her subject cut up—her hand\nseized—her attention demanded, and Mr. Elton actually making violent love\nto her: availing himself of the precious opportunity, declaring sentiments\nwhich must be already well known,\nhoping—fearing—adoring—ready to die if she refused him; but\nflattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and\nunexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short, very\nmuch resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible. It really was\nso. Without scruple—without apology—without much apparent\ndiffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself her\nlover. She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and say it all. Angry\nas she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when\nshe did speak. She felt that half this folly must be drunkenness, and therefore\ncould hope that it might belong only to the passing hour. Accordingly, with a\nmixture of the serious and the playful, which she hoped would best suit his\nhalf and half state, she replied,',
			'“I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to me! you forget\nyourself—you take me for my friend—any message to Miss Smith I\nshall be happy to deliver; but no more of this to me, if you\nplease.”',
			'“Miss Smith!—message to Miss Smith!—What could she possibly\nmean!”—And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent,\nsuch boastful pretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with\nquickness,',
			'“Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account for\nit only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak either to me,\nor of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself enough to say no more, and I\nwill endeavour to forget it.”',
			'But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, not at all to\nconfuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own meaning; and having warmly\nprotested against her suspicion as most injurious, and slightly touched upon\nhis respect for Miss Smith as her friend,—but acknowledging his wonder\nthat Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,—he resumed the subject of his\nown passion, and was very urgent for a favourable answer.',
			'As she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his inconstancy and\npresumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness, replied,',
			'“It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourself too\nclear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can express. After\nsuch behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last month, to Miss\nSmith—such attentions as I have been in the daily habit of\nobserving—to be addressing me in this manner—this is an\nunsteadiness of character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible! Believe\nme, sir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object of such\nprofessions.”',
			'“Good Heaven!” cried Mr. Elton, “what can be the meaning of\nthis?—Miss Smith!—I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course\nof my existence—never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: never\ncared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she has fancied\notherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very sorry—extremely\nsorry—But, Miss Smith, indeed!—Oh! Miss Woodhouse! who can think of\nMiss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my honour, there is no\nunsteadiness of character. I have thought only of you. I protest against having\npaid the smallest attention to any one else. Every thing that I have said or\ndone, for many weeks past, has been with the sole view of marking my adoration\nof yourself. You cannot really, seriously, doubt it. No!—(in an accent\nmeant to be insinuating)—I am sure you have seen and understood\nme.”',
			'It would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this—which of\nall her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She was too completely overpowered\nto be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence being ample\nencouragement for Mr. Elton’s sanguine state of mind, he tried to take\nher hand again, as he joyously exclaimed—',
			'“Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting silence.\nIt confesses that you have long understood me.”',
			'“No, sir,” cried Emma, “it confesses no such thing. So far\nfrom having long understood you, I have been in a most complete error with\nrespect to your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorry that you\nshould have been giving way to any feelings—Nothing could be farther from\nmy wishes—your attachment to my friend Harriet—your pursuit of her,\n(pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been very earnestly\nwishing you success: but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to\nHartfield, I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits\nso frequent. Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself\nparticularly to Miss Smith?—that you have never thought seriously of\nher?”',
			'“Never, madam,” cried he, affronted in his turn: “never, I\nassure you. I think seriously of Miss Smith!—Miss Smith is a very\ngood sort of girl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled. I wish\nher extremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object\nto—Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think,\nquite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance, as\nto be addressing myself to Miss Smith!—No, madam, my visits to Hartfield\nhave been for yourself only; and the encouragement I received—”',
			'“Encouragement!—I give you encouragement!—Sir, you have been\nentirely mistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer of my\nfriend. In no other light could you have been more to me than a common\nacquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake ends\nwhere it does. Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might have been led\ninto a misconception of your views; not being aware, probably, any more than\nmyself, of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of. But, as it\nis, the disappointment is single, and, I trust, will not be lasting. I have no\nthoughts of matrimony at present.”',
			'He was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invite\nsupplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually deep\nmortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer, for the\nfears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace. If there had not been\nso much anger, there would have been desperate awkwardness; but their\nstraightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment.\nWithout knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it\nstopped, they found themselves, all at once, at the door of his house; and he\nwas out before another syllable passed.—Emma then felt it indispensable\nto wish him a good night. The compliment was just returned, coldly and proudly;\nand, under indescribable irritation of spirits, she was then conveyed to\nHartfield.',
			'There she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father, who had been\ntrembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane—turning\na corner which he could never bear to think of—and in strange\nhands—a mere common coachman—no James; and there it seemed as if\nher return only were wanted to make every thing go well: for Mr. John\nKnightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all kindness and attention; and\nso particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father, as to seem—if\nnot quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel—perfectly sensible of its\nbeing exceedingly wholesome; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to\nall their little party, except herself.—But her mind had never been in\nsuch perturbation; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and\ncheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet\nreflection.',
		],
		[
			'The hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think and be\nmiserable.—It was a wretched business indeed!—Such an overthrow of\nevery thing she had been wishing for!—Such a development of every thing\nmost unwelcome!—Such a blow for Harriet!—that was the worst of all.\nEvery part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort or other; but,\ncompared with the evil to Harriet, all was light; and she would gladly have\nsubmitted to feel yet more mistaken—more in error—more disgraced by\nmis-judgment, than she actually was, could the effects of her blunders have\nbeen confined to herself.',
			'“If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have borne\nany thing. He might have doubled his presumption to me—but poor\nHarriet!”',
			'How she could have been so deceived!—He protested that he had never\nthought seriously of Harriet—never! She looked back as well as she could;\nbut it was all confusion. She had taken up the idea, she supposed, and made\nevery thing bend to it. His manners, however, must have been unmarked,\nwavering, dubious, or she could not have been so misled.',
			'The picture!—How eager he had been about the picture!—and the\ncharade!—and an hundred other circumstances;—how clearly they had\nseemed to point at Harriet. To be sure, the charade, with its “ready\nwit”—but then the “soft eyes”—in fact it suited\nneither; it was a jumble without taste or truth. Who could have seen through\nsuch thick-headed nonsense?',
			'Certainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners to herself\nunnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way, as a mere error of\njudgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among others that he had not\nalways lived in the best society, that with all the gentleness of his address,\ntrue elegance was sometimes wanting; but, till this very day, she had never,\nfor an instant, suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as\nHarriet’s friend.',
			'To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject, for\nthe first start of its possibility. There was no denying that those brothers\nhad penetration. She remembered what Mr. Knightley had once said to her about\nMr. Elton, the caution he had given, the conviction he had professed that Mr.\nElton would never marry indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a\nknowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached\nherself. It was dreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving himself, in\nmany respects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him; proud,\nassuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and little concerned about\nthe feelings of others.',
			'Contrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton’s wanting to pay his\naddresses to her had sunk him in her opinion. His professions and his proposals\ndid him no service. She thought nothing of his attachment, and was insulted by\nhis hopes. He wanted to marry well, and having the arrogance to raise his eyes\nto her, pretended to be in love; but she was perfectly easy as to his not\nsuffering any disappointment that need be cared for. There had been no real\naffection either in his language or manners. Sighs and fine words had been\ngiven in abundance; but she could hardly devise any set of expressions, or\nfancy any tone of voice, less allied with real love. She need not trouble\nherself to pity him. He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if\nMiss Woodhouse of Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not\nquite so easily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss Somebody\nelse with twenty, or with ten.',
			'But—that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as aware of\nhis views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), to marry\nhim!—should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!—look\ndown upon her friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below him,\nand be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing no presumption\nin addressing her!—It was most provoking.',
			'Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior\nin talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very want of such equality might\nprevent his perception of it; but he must know that in fortune and consequence\nshe was greatly his superior. He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled\nfor several generations at Hartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient\nfamily—and that the Eltons were nobody. The landed property of Hartfield\ncertainly was inconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey\nestate, to which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from\nother sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey\nitself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses had long held a\nhigh place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which Mr. Elton had first\nentered not two years ago, to make his way as he could, without any alliances\nbut in trade, or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his\ncivility.—But he had fancied her in love with him; that evidently must\nhave been his dependence; and after raving a little about the seeming\nincongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common\nhonesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant\nand obliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing her real motive\nunperceived) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy, like Mr.\nElton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite. If she had so\nmisinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to wonder that he,\nwith self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken hers.',
			'The first error and the worst lay at her door. It was foolish, it was wrong, to\ntake so active a part in bringing any two people together. It was adventuring\ntoo far, assuming too much, making light of what ought to be serious, a trick\nof what ought to be simple. She was quite concerned and ashamed, and resolved\nto do such things no more.',
			'“Here have I,” said she, “actually talked poor Harriet into\nbeing very much attached to this man. She might never have thought of him but\nfor me; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope, if I had not\nassured her of his attachment, for she is as modest and humble as I used to\nthink him. Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept\nyoung Martin. There I was quite right. That was well done of me; but there I\nshould have stopped, and left the rest to time and chance. I was introducing\nher into good company, and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one\nworth having; I ought not to have attempted more. But now, poor girl, her peace\nis cut up for some time. I have been but half a friend to her; and if she were\nnot to feel this disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an\nidea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her;—William\nCoxe—Oh! no, I could not endure William Coxe—a pert young\nlawyer.”',
			'She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed a more\nserious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might be, and must\nbe. The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet, and all that poor\nHarriet would be suffering, with the awkwardness of future meetings, the\ndifficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing\nfeelings, concealing resentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy her\nin most unmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went to bed at last\nwith nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most\ndreadfully.',
			'To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma’s, though under temporary\ngloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits.\nThe youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy, and of powerful\noperation; and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes\nunclosed, they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter\nhope.',
			'Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed,\nmore ready to see alleviations of the evil before her, and to depend on getting\ntolerably out of it.',
			'It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in love with\nher, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint\nhim—that Harriet’s nature should not be of that superior sort in\nwhich the feelings are most acute and retentive—and that there could be\nno necessity for any body’s knowing what had passed except the three\nprincipals, and especially for her father’s being given a moment’s\nuneasiness about it.',
			'These were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the\nground did her further service, for any thing was welcome that might justify\ntheir all three being quite asunder at present.',
			'The weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day, she could not go\nto church. Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted\nit, and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and\nmost unsuitable ideas. The ground covered with snow, and the atmosphere in that\nunsettled state between frost and thaw, which is of all others the most\nunfriendly for exercise, every morning beginning in rain or snow, and every\nevening setting in to freeze, she was for many days a most honourable prisoner.\nNo intercourse with Harriet possible but by note; no church for her on Sunday\nany more than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses for Mr.\nElton’s absenting himself.',
			'It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and though she\nhoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other, it\nwas very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone\nin his own house, too wise to stir out; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley,\nwhom no weather could keep entirely from them,—',
			'“Ah! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr.\nElton?”',
			'These days of confinement would have been, but for her private perplexities,\nremarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited her brother, whose\nfeelings must always be of great importance to his companions; and he had,\nbesides, so thoroughly cleared off his ill-humour at Randalls, that his\namiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at Hartfield. He was\nalways agreeable and obliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body. But with\nall the hopes of cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was\nstill such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet, as\nmade it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease.',
		],
		[
			'Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield. The weather\nsoon improved enough for those to move who must move; and Mr. Woodhouse having,\nas usual, tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children,\nwas obliged to see the whole party set off, and return to his lamentations over\nthe destiny of poor Isabella;—which poor Isabella, passing her life with\nthose she doated on, full of their merits, blind to their faults, and always\ninnocently busy, might have been a model of right feminine happiness.',
			'The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr. Elton to\nMr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note, to say, with Mr. Elton’s\nbest compliments, “that he was proposing to leave Highbury the following\nmorning in his way to Bath; where, in compliance with the pressing entreaties\nof some friends, he had engaged to spend a few weeks, and very much regretted\nthe impossibility he was under, from various circumstances of weather and\nbusiness, of taking a personal leave of Mr. Woodhouse, of whose friendly\ncivilities he should ever retain a grateful sense—and had Mr. Woodhouse\nany commands, should be happy to attend to them.”',
			'Emma was most agreeably surprized.—Mr. Elton’s absence just at this\ntime was the very thing to be desired. She admired him for contriving it,\nthough not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was\nannounced. Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a\ncivility to her father, from which she was so pointedly excluded. She had not\neven a share in his opening compliments.—Her name was not\nmentioned;—and there was so striking a change in all this, and such an\nill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments, as she\nthought, at first, could not escape her father’s suspicion.',
			'It did, however.—Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so\nsudden a journey, and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get safely to the\nend of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language. It was a very useful\nnote, for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation\nduring the rest of their lonely evening. Mr. Woodhouse talked over his alarms,\nand Emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude.',
			'She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark. She had reason to\nbelieve her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was desirable that she\nshould have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other\ncomplaint before the gentleman’s return. She went to Mrs. Goddard’s\naccordingly the very next day, to undergo the necessary penance of\ncommunication; and a severe one it was.—She had to destroy all the hopes\nwhich she had been so industriously feeding—to appear in the ungracious\ncharacter of the one preferred—and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken\nand mis-judging in all her ideas on one subject, all her observations, all her\nconvictions, all her prophecies for the last six weeks.',
			'The confession completely renewed her first shame—and the sight of\nHarriet’s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with\nherself again.',
			'Harriet bore the intelligence very well—blaming nobody—and in every\nthing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of\nherself, as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend.',
			'Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost; and all\nthat was amiable, all that ought to be attaching, seemed on Harriet’s\nside, not her own. Harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to\ncomplain of. The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton would have been too great\na distinction.—She never could have deserved him—and nobody but so\npartial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible.',
			'Her tears fell abundantly—but her grief was so truly artless, that no\ndignity could have made it more respectable in Emma’s eyes—and she\nlistened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and\nunderstanding—really for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior\ncreature of the two—and that to resemble her would be more for her own\nwelfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do.',
			'It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded and\nignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being\nhumble and discreet, and repressing imagination all the rest of her life. Her\nsecond duty now, inferior only to her father’s claims, was to promote\nHarriet’s comfort, and endeavour to prove her own affection in some\nbetter method than by match-making. She got her to Hartfield, and shewed her\nthe most unvarying kindness, striving to occupy and amuse her, and by books and\nconversation, to drive Mr. Elton from her thoughts.',
			'Time, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and she could\nsuppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general, and very\ninadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton in particular; but it\nseemed to her reasonable that at Harriet’s age, and with the entire\nextinction of all hope, such a progress might be made towards a state of\ncomposure by the time of Mr. Elton’s return, as to allow them all to meet\nagain in the common routine of acquaintance, without any danger of betraying\nsentiments or increasing them.',
			'Harriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence of any\nbody equal to him in person or goodness—and did, in truth, prove herself\nmore resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen; but yet it appeared to her so\nnatural, so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort\nunrequited, that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in\nequal force.',
			'If Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident and\nindubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do, she could not imagine\nHarriet’s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the\nrecollection of him.',
			'Their being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad for each,\nfor all three. Not one of them had the power of removal, or of effecting any\nmaterial change of society. They must encounter each other, and make the best\nof it.',
			'Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs.\nGoddard’s; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great\ngirls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any\nchance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth.\nWhere the wound had been given, there must the cure be found if anywhere; and\nEmma felt that, till she saw her in the way of cure, there could be no true\npeace for herself.',

		[
			'Mr. Frank Churchill did not come. When the time proposed drew near, Mrs.\nWeston’s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse. For\nthe present, he could not be spared, to his “very great mortification and\nregret; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no\ndistant period.”',
			'Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed—much more disappointed, in fact,\nthan her husband, though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so\nmuch more sober: but a sanguine temper, though for ever expecting more good\nthan occurs, does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression.\nIt soon flies over the present failure, and begins to hope again. For half an\nhour Mr. Weston was surprized and sorry; but then he began to perceive that\nFrank’s coming two or three months later would be a much better plan;\nbetter time of year; better weather; and that he would be able, without any\ndoubt, to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner.',
			'These feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston, of a more\napprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and\ndelays; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer, suffered\na great deal more herself.',
			'Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr. Frank\nChurchill’s not coming, except as a disappointment at Randalls. The\nacquaintance at present had no charm for her. She wanted, rather, to be quiet,\nand out of temptation; but still, as it was desirable that she should appear,\nin general, like her usual self, she took care to express as much interest in\nthe circumstance, and enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston’s\ndisappointment, as might naturally belong to their friendship.',
			'She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quite as much\nas was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rather more,) at the\nconduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away. She then proceeded to say a\ngood deal more than she felt, of the advantage of such an addition to their\nconfined society in Surry; the pleasure of looking at somebody new; the\ngala-day to Highbury entire, which the sight of him would have made; and ending\nwith reflections on the Churchills again, found herself directly involved in a\ndisagreement with Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that\nshe was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and making\nuse of Mrs. Weston’s arguments against herself.',
			'“The Churchills are very likely in fault,” said Mr. Knightley,\ncoolly; “but I dare say he might come if he would.”',
			'“I do not know why you should say so. He wishes exceedingly to come; but\nhis uncle and aunt will not spare him.”',
			'“I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made a point\nof it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof.”',
			'“How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you suppose\nhim such an unnatural creature?”',
			'“I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting that\nhe may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care very little for any\nthing but his own pleasure, from living with those who have always set him the\nexample of it. It is a great deal more natural than one could wish, that a\nyoung man, brought up by those who are proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be\nproud, luxurious, and selfish too. If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his\nfather, he would have contrived it between September and January. A man at his\nage—what is he?—three or four-and-twenty—cannot be without\nthe means of doing as much as that. It is impossible.”',
			'“That’s easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been\nyour own master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the\ndifficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to have tempers to\nmanage.”',
			'“It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty should\nnot have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He cannot want money—he\ncannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he has so much of both,\nthat he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom. We hear\nof him for ever at some watering-place or other. A little while ago, he was at\nWeymouth. This proves that he can leave the Churchills.”',
			'“Yes, sometimes he can.”',
			'“And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever\nthere is any temptation of pleasure.”',
			'“It is very unfair to judge of any body’s conduct, without an\nintimate knowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in the interior\nof a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may\nbe. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs. Churchill’s\ntemper, before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do. He may, at\ntimes, be able to do a great deal more than he can at others.”',
			'“There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, and\nthat is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and\nresolution. It is Frank Churchill’s duty to pay this attention to his\nfather. He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but if he wished to\ndo it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would say at once, simply and\nresolutely, to Mrs. Churchill—‘Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you\nwill always find me ready to make to your convenience; but I must go and see my\nfather immediately. I know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of\nrespect to him on the present occasion. I shall, therefore, set off\nto-morrow.’—If he would say so to her at once, in the tone of\ndecision becoming a man, there would be no opposition made to his going.”',
			'“No,” said Emma, laughing; “but perhaps there might be some\nmade to his coming back again. Such language for a young man entirely\ndependent, to use!—Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it\npossible. But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly\nopposite to your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to\nthe uncle and aunt, who have brought him up, and are to provide for\nhim!—Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as\nloud as he could!—How can you imagine such conduct practicable?”',
			'“Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it. He\nwould feel himself in the right; and the declaration—made, of course, as\na man of sense would make it, in a proper manner—would do him more good,\nraise him higher, fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on,\nthan all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do. Respect would be\nadded to affection. They would feel that they could trust him; that the nephew\nwho had done rightly by his father, would do rightly by them; for they know, as\nwell as he does, as well as all the world must know, that he ought to pay this\nvisit to his father; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in\ntheir hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims.\nRespect for right conduct is felt by every body. If he would act in this sort\nof manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their little minds would bend\nto his.”',
			'“I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; but\nwhere little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they have a\nknack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones. I can\nimagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, were to be transported and\nplaced all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill’s situation, you would be able\nto say and do just what you have been recommending for him; and it might have a\nvery good effect. The Churchills might not have a word to say in return; but\nthen, you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break\nthrough. To him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into\nperfect independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at\nnought. He may have as strong a sense of what would be right, as you can have,\nwithout being so equal, under particular circumstances, to act up to it.”',
			'“Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal\nexertion, it could not be an equal conviction.”',
			'“Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try to\nunderstand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing\nthose, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life.”',
			'“Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first\noccasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of\nothers. It ought to have been a habit with him by this time, of following his\nduty, instead of consulting expediency. I can allow for the fears of the child,\nbut not of the man. As he became rational, he ought to have roused himself and\nshaken off all that was unworthy in their authority. He ought to have opposed\nthe first attempt on their side to make him slight his father. Had he begun as\nhe ought, there would have been no difficulty now.”',
			'“We shall never agree about him,” cried Emma; “but that is\nnothing extraordinary. I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man:\nI feel sure that he is not. Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly, though in\nhis own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding, complying, mild\ndisposition than would suit your notions of man’s perfection. I dare say\nhe has; and though it may cut him off from some advantages, it will secure him\nmany others.”',
			'“Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move, and of\nleading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremely expert in\nfinding excuses for it. He can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter,\nfull of professions and falsehoods, and persuade himself that he has hit upon\nthe very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing\nhis father’s having any right to complain. His letters disgust me.”',
			'“Your feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body else.”',
			'“I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can satisfy a\nwoman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother’s place,\nbut without a mother’s affection to blind her. It is on her account that\nattention to Randalls is doubly due, and she must doubly feel the omission. Had\nshe been a person of consequence herself, he would have come I dare say; and it\nwould not have signified whether he did or no. Can you think your friend\nbehindhand in these sort of considerations? Do you suppose she does not often\nsay all this to herself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable only\nin French, not in English. He may be very ‘amiable,’ have very good\nmanners, and be very agreeable; but he can have no English delicacy towards the\nfeelings of other people: nothing really amiable about him.”',
			'“You seem determined to think ill of him.”',
			'“Me!—not at all,” replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased;\n“I do not want to think ill of him. I should be as ready to acknowledge\nhis merits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are merely\npersonal; that he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth, plausible\nmanners.”',
			'“Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a treasure at\nHighbury. We do not often look upon fine young men, well-bred and agreeable. We\nmust not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain. Cannot you\nimagine, Mr. Knightley, what a sensation his coming will produce? There\nwill be but one subject throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury; but\none interest—one object of curiosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill;\nwe shall think and speak of nobody else.”',
			'“You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him\nconversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only a\nchattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts.”',
			'“My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of\nevery body, and has the power as well as the wish of being universally\nagreeable. To you, he will talk of farming; to me, of drawing or music; and so\non to every body, having that general information on all subjects which will\nenable him to follow the lead, or take the lead, just as propriety may require,\nand to speak extremely well on each; that is my idea of him.”',
			'“And mine,” said Mr. Knightley warmly, “is, that if he turn\nout any thing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing! What!\nat three-and-twenty to be the king of his company—the great man—the\npractised politician, who is to read every body’s character, and make\nevery body’s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority; to be\ndispensing his flatteries around, that he may make all appear like fools\ncompared with himself! My dear Emma, your own good sense could not endure such\na puppy when it came to the point.”',
			'“I will say no more about him,” cried Emma, “you turn every\nthing to evil. We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him; and we have no\nchance of agreeing till he is really here.”',
			'“Prejudiced! I am not prejudiced.”',
			'“But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it. My love for\nMr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour.”',
			'“He is a person I never think of from one month’s end to\nanother,” said Mr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma\nimmediately talk of something else, though she could not comprehend why he\nshould be angry.',
			'To take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be of a different\ndisposition from himself, was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she\nwas always used to acknowledge in him; for with all the high opinion of\nhimself, which she had often laid to his charge, she had never before for a\nmoment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another.',

		[
			'Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, in Emma’s\nopinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day. She could not think\nthat Harriet’s solace or her own sins required more; and she was\ntherefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned;—but\nit burst out again when she thought she had succeeded, and after speaking some\ntime of what the poor must suffer in winter, and receiving no other answer than\na very plaintive—“Mr. Elton is so good to the poor!” she\nfound something else must be done.',
			'They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates. She\ndetermined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers. There was always\nsufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and Miss Bates loved to be called\non, and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see\nimperfection in her, as rather negligent in that respect, and as not\ncontributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts.',
			'She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart, as to\nher deficiency—but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its\nbeing very disagreeable,—a waste of time—tiresome women—and\nall the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and\nthird-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever, and therefore she\nseldom went near them. But now she made the sudden resolution of not passing\ntheir door without going in—observing, as she proposed it to Harriet,\nthat, as well as she could calculate, they were just now quite safe from any\nletter from Jane Fairfax.',
			'The house belonged to people in business. Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied the\ndrawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized apartment, which was\nevery thing to them, the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully\nwelcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who with her knitting was seated in the\nwarmest corner, wanting even to give up her place to Miss Woodhouse, and her\nmore active, talking daughter, almost ready to overpower them with care and\nkindness, thanks for their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries\nafter Mr. Woodhouse’s health, cheerful communications about her\nmother’s, and sweet-cake from the beaufet—“Mrs. Cole had just\nbeen there, just called in for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an\nhour with them, and she had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to\nsay she liked it very much; and, therefore, she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss\nSmith would do them the favour to eat a piece too.”',
			'The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton. There\nwas intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr. Elton since his\ngoing away. Emma knew what was coming; they must have the letter over again,\nand settle how long he had been gone, and how much he was engaged in company,\nand what a favourite he was wherever he went, and how full the Master of the\nCeremonies’ ball had been; and she went through it very well, with all\nthe interest and all the commendation that could be requisite, and always\nputting forward to prevent Harriet’s being obliged to say a word.',
			'This she had been prepared for when she entered the house; but meant, having\nonce talked him handsomely over, to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome\ntopic, and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of\nHighbury, and their card-parties. She had not been prepared to have Jane\nFairfax succeed Mr. Elton; but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates, she\njumped away from him at last abruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from\nher niece.',
			'“Oh! yes—Mr. Elton, I understand—certainly as to\ndancing—Mrs. Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath\nwas—Mrs. Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane;\nfor as soon as she came in, she began inquiring after her, Jane is so very\ngreat a favourite there. Whenever she is with us, Mrs. Cole does not know how\nto shew her kindness enough; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as\nany body can. And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying, ‘I\nknow you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time for\nwriting;’ and when I immediately said, ‘But indeed we have, we had\na letter this very morning,’ I do not know that I ever saw any body more\nsurprized. ‘Have you, upon your honour?’ said she; ‘well,\nthat is quite unexpected. Do let me hear what she says.’”',
			'Emma’s politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling\ninterest—',
			'“Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately? I am extremely happy. I hope\nshe is well?”',
			'“Thank you. You are so kind!” replied the happily deceived aunt,\nwhile eagerly hunting for the letter.—“Oh! here it is. I was sure\nit could not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see, without\nbeing aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so very lately\nthat I was almost sure it must be on the table. I was reading it to Mrs. Cole,\nand since she went away, I was reading it again to my mother, for it is such a\npleasure to her—a letter from Jane—that she can never hear it often\nenough; so I knew it could not be far off, and here it is, only just under my\nhuswife—and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she\nsays;—but, first of all, I really must, in justice to Jane, apologise for\nher writing so short a letter—only two pages you see—hardly\ntwo—and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half. My mother\noften wonders that I can make it out so well. She often says, when the letter\nis first opened, ‘Well, Hetty, now I think you will be put to it to make\nout all that checker-work’—don’t you, ma’am?—And\nthen I tell her, I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself, if she\nhad nobody to do it for her—every word of it—I am sure she would\npore over it till she had made out every word. And, indeed, though my\nmother’s eyes are not so good as they were, she can see amazingly well\nstill, thank God! with the help of spectacles. It is such a blessing! My\nmother’s are really very good indeed. Jane often says, when she is here,\n‘I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very strong eyes to see as you\ndo—and so much fine work as you have done too!—I only wish my eyes\nmay last me as well.’”',
			'All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath; and Emma\nsaid something very civil about the excellence of Miss Fairfax’s\nhandwriting.',
			'“You are extremely kind,” replied Miss Bates, highly gratified;\n“you who are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself. I am sure\nthere is nobody’s praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss\nWoodhouse’s. My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf you know.\nMa’am,” addressing her, “do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is\nso obliging to say about Jane’s handwriting?”',
			'And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice\nover before the good old lady could comprehend it. She was pondering, in the\nmeanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming very rude, of making her\nescape from Jane Fairfax’s letter, and had almost resolved on hurrying\naway directly under some slight excuse, when Miss Bates turned to her again and\nseized her attention.',
			'“My mother’s deafness is very trifling you see—just nothing\nat all. By only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,\nshe is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice. But it is very\nremarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me. Jane\nspeaks so distinct! However, she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than\nshe was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at my mother’s time\nof life—and it really is full two years, you know, since she was here. We\nnever were so long without seeing her before, and as I was telling Mrs. Cole,\nwe shall hardly know how to make enough of her now.”',
			'“Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?”',
			'“Oh yes; next week.”',
			'“Indeed!—that must be a very great pleasure.”',
			'“Thank you. You are very kind. Yes, next week. Every body is so\nsurprized; and every body says the same obliging things. I am sure she will be\nas happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they can be to see her. Yes, Friday\nor Saturday; she cannot say which, because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the\ncarriage himself one of those days. So very good of them to send her the whole\nway! But they always do, you know. Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next. That is\nwhat she writes about. That is the reason of her writing out of rule, as we\ncall it; for, in the common course, we should not have heard from her before\nnext Tuesday or Wednesday.”',
			'“Yes, so I imagined. I was afraid there could be little chance of my\nhearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day.”',
			'“So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had not been for\nthis particular circumstance, of her being to come here so soon. My mother is\nso delighted!—for she is to be three months with us at least. Three\nmonths, she says so, positively, as I am going to have the pleasure of reading\nto you. The case is, you see, that the Campbells are going to Ireland. Mrs.\nDixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly.\nThey had not intended to go over till the summer, but she is so impatient to\nsee them again—for till she married, last October, she was never away\nfrom them so much as a week, which must make it very strange to be in different\nkingdoms, I was going to say, but however different countries, and so she wrote\na very urgent letter to her mother—or her father, I declare I do not know\nwhich it was, but we shall see presently in Jane’s letter—wrote in\nMr. Dixon’s name as well as her own, to press their coming over directly,\nand they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to their\ncountry seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy. Jane has heard a great\ndeal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean—I do not know that she ever\nheard about it from any body else; but it was very natural, you know, that he\nshould like to speak of his own place while he was paying his\naddresses—and as Jane used to be very often walking out with\nthem—for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their\ndaughter’s not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not\nat all blame them; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss\nCampbell about his own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word that he\nhad shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he had taken himself. He\nis a most amiable, charming young man, I believe. Jane was quite longing to go\nto Ireland, from his account of things.”',
			'At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma’s\nbrain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the not going\nto Ireland, she said, with the insidious design of farther discovery,',
			'“You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to\ncome to you at such a time. Considering the very particular friendship between\nher and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected her to be excused from\naccompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.”',
			'“Very true, very true, indeed. The very thing that we have always been\nrather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her at such a distance\nfrom us, for months together—not able to come if any thing was to happen.\nBut you see, every thing turns out for the best. They want her (Mr. and Mrs.\nDixon) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell; quite depend\nupon it; nothing can be more kind or pressing than their joint\ninvitation, Jane says, as you will hear presently; Mr. Dixon does not seem in\nthe least backward in any attention. He is a most charming young man. Ever\nsince the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth, when they were out in that\nparty on the water, and she, by the sudden whirling round of something or other\namong the sails, would have been dashed into the sea at once, and actually was\nall but gone, if he had not, with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of\nher habit— (I can never think of it without trembling!)—But ever\nsince we had the history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!”',
			'“But, in spite of all her friends’ urgency, and her own wish of\nseeing Ireland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs.\nBates?”',
			'“Yes—entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Colonel\nand Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they should recommend;\nand indeed they particularly wish her to try her native air, as she has\nnot been quite so well as usual lately.”',
			'“I am concerned to hear of it. I think they judge wisely. But Mrs. Dixon\nmust be very much disappointed. Mrs. Dixon, I understand, has no remarkable\ndegree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to be compared with Miss\nFairfax.”',
			'“Oh! no. You are very obliging to say such things—but certainly\nnot. There is no comparison between them. Miss Campbell always was absolutely\nplain—but extremely elegant and amiable.”',
			'“Yes, that of course.”',
			'“Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of November,\n(as I am going to read to you,) and has never been well since. A long time, is\nnot it, for a cold to hang upon her? She never mentioned it before, because she\nwould not alarm us. Just like her! so considerate!—But however, she is so\nfar from well, that her kind friends the Campbells think she had better come\nhome, and try an air that always agrees with her; and they have no doubt that\nthree or four months at Highbury will entirely cure her—and it is\ncertainly a great deal better that she should come here, than go to Ireland, if\nshe is unwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we should do.”',
			'“It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.”',
			'“And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbells\nleave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following—as you will find\nfrom Jane’s letter. So sudden!—You may guess, dear Miss Woodhouse,\nwhat a flurry it has thrown me in! If it was not for the drawback of her\nillness—but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin, and looking\nvery poorly. I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me, as to that.\nI always make a point of reading Jane’s letters through to myself first,\nbefore I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for fear of there being any\nthing in them to distress her. Jane desired me to do it, so I always do: and so\nI began to-day with my usual caution; but no sooner did I come to the mention\nof her being unwell, than I burst out, quite frightened, with ‘Bless me!\npoor Jane is ill!’—which my mother, being on the watch, heard\ndistinctly, and was sadly alarmed at. However, when I read on, I found it was\nnot near so bad as I had fancied at first; and I make so light of it now to\nher, that she does not think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could be\nso off my guard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry. The\nexpense shall not be thought of; and though he is so liberal, and so fond of\nJane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance, we\ncould not suffer it to be so, you know. He has a wife and family to maintain,\nand is not to be giving away his time. Well, now I have just given you a hint\nof what Jane writes about, we will turn to her letter, and I am sure she tells\nher own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her.”',
			'“I am afraid we must be running away,” said Emma, glancing at\nHarriet, and beginning to rise—“My father will be expecting us. I\nhad no intention, I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes,\nwhen I first entered the house. I merely called, because I would not pass the\ndoor without inquiring after Mrs. Bates; but I have been so pleasantly\ndetained! Now, however, we must wish you and Mrs. Bates good morning.”',
			'And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded. She regained the\nstreet—happy in this, that though much had been forced on her against her\nwill, though she had in fact heard the whole substance of Jane Fairfax’s\nletter, she had been able to escape the letter itself.',

		[
			'Jane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates’s youngest\ndaughter.',
			'The marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the ——regiment of infantry, and\nMiss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure, hope and interest; but\nnothing now remained of it, save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in\naction abroad—of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon\nafterwards—and this girl.',
			'By birth she belonged to Highbury: and when at three years old, on losing her\nmother, she became the property, the charge, the consolation, the foundling of\nher grandmother and aunt, there had seemed every probability of her being\npermanently fixed there; of her being taught only what very limited means could\ncommand, and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement, to be\nengrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person, good\nunderstanding, and warm-hearted, well-meaning relations.',
			'But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her\ndestiny. This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly regarded Fairfax, as an\nexcellent officer and most deserving young man; and farther, had been indebted\nto him for such attentions, during a severe camp-fever, as he believed had\nsaved his life. These were claims which he did not learn to overlook, though\nsome years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax, before his own return to\nEngland put any thing in his power. When he did return, he sought out the child\nand took notice of her. He was a married man, with only one living child, a\ngirl, about Jane’s age: and Jane became their guest, paying them long\nvisits and growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years old, his\ndaughter’s great fondness for her, and his own wish of being a real\nfriend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the\nwhole charge of her education. It was accepted; and from that period Jane had\nbelonged to Colonel Campbell’s family, and had lived with them entirely,\nonly visiting her grandmother from time to time.',
			'The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; the very few\nhundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence\nimpossible. To provide for her otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell’s\npower; for though his income, by pay and appointments, was handsome, his\nfortune was moderate and must be all his daughter’s; but, by giving her\nan education, he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence\nhereafter.',
			'Such was Jane Fairfax’s history. She had fallen into good hands, known\nnothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellent education.\nLiving constantly with right-minded and well-informed people, her heart and\nunderstanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture; and\nColonel Campbell’s residence being in London, every lighter talent had\nbeen done full justice to, by the attendance of first-rate masters. Her\ndisposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do;\nand at eighteen or nineteen she was, as far as such an early age can be\nqualified for the care of children, fully competent to the office of\ninstruction herself; but she was too much beloved to be parted with. Neither\nfather nor mother could promote, and the daughter could not endure it. The evil\nday was put off. It was easy to decide that she was still too young; and Jane\nremained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all the rational pleasures\nof an elegant society, and a judicious mixture of home and amusement, with only\nthe drawback of the future, the sobering suggestions of her own good\nunderstanding to remind her that all this might soon be over.',
			'The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in\nparticular, was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of\nJane’s decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements. That nature\nhad given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman, nor could her\nhigher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents. They continued together with\nunabated regard however, till the marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that\nchance, that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs,\ngiving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged\nthe affections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as soon as\nthey were acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled, while Jane Fairfax\nhad yet her bread to earn.',
			'This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be yet\nattempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty;\nthough she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for\nbeginning. She had long resolved that one-and-twenty should be the period. With\nthe fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she had resolved at one-and-twenty to\ncomplete the sacrifice, and retire from all the pleasures of life, of rational\nintercourse, equal society, peace and hope, to penance and mortification for\never.',
			'The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such a resolution,\nthough their feelings did. As long as they lived, no exertions would be\nnecessary, their home might be hers for ever; and for their own comfort they\nwould have retained her wholly; but this would be selfishness:—what must\nbe at last, had better be soon. Perhaps they began to feel it might have been\nkinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay, and spared her\nfrom a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be\nrelinquished. Still, however, affection was glad to catch at any reasonable\nexcuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment. She had never been quite well\nsince the time of their daughter’s marriage; and till she should have\ncompletely recovered her usual strength, they must forbid her engaging in\nduties, which, so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying\nspirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances, to require something\nmore than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable\ncomfort.',
			'With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account to her aunt\ncontained nothing but truth, though there might be some truths not told. It was\nher own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury; to spend,\nperhaps, her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom\nshe was so very dear: and the Campbells, whatever might be their motive or\nmotives, whether single, or double, or treble, gave the arrangement their ready\nsanction, and said, that they depended more on a few months spent in her native\nair, for the recovery of her health, than on any thing else. Certain it was\nthat she was to come; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect\nnovelty which had been so long promised it—Mr. Frank Churchill—must\nput up for the present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the freshness of\na two years’ absence.',
			'Emma was sorry;—to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like\nthrough three long months!—to be always doing more than she wished, and\nless than she ought! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult\nquestion to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in\nher the really accomplished young woman, which she wanted to be thought\nherself; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time, there\nwere moments of self-examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit\nher. But “she could never get acquainted with her: she did not know how\nit was, but there was such coldness and reserve—such apparent\nindifference whether she pleased or not—and then, her aunt was such an\neternal talker!—and she was made such a fuss with by every\nbody!—and it had been always imagined that they were to be so\nintimate—because their ages were the same, every body had supposed they\nmust be so fond of each other.” These were her reasons—she had no\nbetter.',
			'It was a dislike so little just—every imputed fault was so magnified by\nfancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable\nabsence, without feeling that she had injured her; and now, when the due visit\nwas paid, on her arrival, after a two years’ interval, she was\nparticularly struck with the very appearance and manners, which for those two\nwhole years she had been depreciating. Jane Fairfax was very elegant,\nremarkably elegant; and she had herself the highest value for elegance. Her\nheight was pretty, just such as almost every body would think tall, and nobody\ncould think very tall; her figure particularly graceful; her size a most\nbecoming medium, between fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health\nseemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not but feel all\nthis; and then, her face—her features—there was more beauty in them\naltogether than she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very\npleasing beauty. Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had\nnever been denied their praise; but the skin, which she had been used to cavil\nat, as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no\nfuller bloom. It was a style of beauty, of which elegance was the reigning\ncharacter, and as such, she must, in honour, by all her principles, admire\nit:—elegance, which, whether of person or of mind, she saw so little in\nHighbury. There, not to be vulgar, was distinction, and merit.',
			'In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold\ncomplacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice, and was\ndetermining that she would dislike her no longer. When she took in her history,\nindeed, her situation, as well as her beauty; when she considered what all this\nelegance was destined to, what she was going to sink from, how she was going to\nlive, it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect;\nespecially, if to every well-known particular entitling her to interest, were\nadded the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she\nhad so naturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could be more\npitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on. Emma was\nvery willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon’s affections\nfrom his wife, or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested\nat first. If it were love, it might be simple, single, successless love on her\nside alone. She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison, while\na sharer of his conversation with her friend; and from the best, the purest of\nmotives, might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to\ndivide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her\ncareer of laborious duty.',
			'Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings, as made\nher look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury afforded no young man\nworthy of giving her independence; nobody that she could wish to scheme about\nfor her.',
			'These were charming feelings—but not lasting. Before she had committed\nherself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax, or\ndone more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors, than saying to\nMr. Knightley, “She certainly is handsome; she is better than\nhandsome!” Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother\nand aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state. Former\nprovocations reappeared. The aunt was as tiresome as ever; more tiresome,\nbecause anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers; and\nthey had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter\nshe ate for breakfast, and how small a slice of mutton for dinner, as well as\nto see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself; and\nJane’s offences rose again. They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and\nthe thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation\nof candour, an air of greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her\nown very superior performance. She was, besides, which was the worst of all, so\ncold, so cautious! There was no getting at her real opinion. Wrapt up in a\ncloak of politeness, she seemed determined to hazard nothing. She was\ndisgustingly, was suspiciously reserved.',
			'If any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more reserved on the\nsubject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. She seemed bent on giving no\nreal insight into Mr. Dixon’s character, or her own value for his\ncompany, or opinion of the suitableness of the match. It was all general\napprobation and smoothness; nothing delineated or distinguished. It did her no\nservice however. Her caution was thrown away. Emma saw its artifice, and\nreturned to her first surmises. There probably was something more to\nconceal than her own preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps, had been very near\nchanging one friend for the other, or been fixed only to Miss Campbell, for the\nsake of the future twelve thousand pounds.',
			'The like reserve prevailed on other topics. She and Mr. Frank Churchill had\nbeen at Weymouth at the same time. It was known that they were a little\nacquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma procure as to\nwhat he truly was. “Was he handsome?”—“She believed he\nwas reckoned a very fine young man.” “Was he\nagreeable?”—“He was generally thought so.” “Did\nhe appear a sensible young man; a young man of\ninformation?”—“At a watering-place, or in a common London\nacquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points. Manners were all that\ncould be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had\nof Mr. Churchill. She believed every body found his manners pleasing.”\nEmma could not forgive her.',
		],
		[
			'Emma could not forgive her;—but as neither provocation nor resentment\nwere discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had seen only\nproper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he was expressing the\nnext morning, being at Hartfield again on business with Mr. Woodhouse, his\napprobation of the whole; not so openly as he might have done had her father\nbeen out of the room, but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to\nEmma. He had been used to think her unjust to Jane, and had now great pleasure\nin marking an improvement.',
			'“A very pleasant evening,” he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had\nbeen talked into what was necessary, told that he understood, and the papers\nswept away;—“particularly pleasant. You and Miss Fairfax gave us\nsome very good music. I do not know a more luxurious state, sir, than sitting\nat one’s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women;\nsometimes with music and sometimes with conversation. I am sure Miss Fairfax\nmust have found the evening pleasant, Emma. You left nothing undone. I was glad\nyou made her play so much, for having no instrument at her grandmother’s,\nit must have been a real indulgence.”',
			'“I am happy you approved,” said Emma, smiling; “but I hope I\nam not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.”',
			'“No, my dear,” said her father instantly; “that I am\nsure you are not. There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are. If\nany thing, you are too attentive. The muffin last night—if it had been\nhanded round once, I think it would have been enough.”',
			'“No,” said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; “you are\nnot often deficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension. I\nthink you understand me, therefore.”',
			'An arch look expressed—“I understand you well enough;” but\nshe said only, “Miss Fairfax is reserved.”',
			'“I always told you she was—a little; but you will soon overcome all\nthat part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that has its\nfoundation in diffidence. What arises from discretion must be honoured.”',
			'“You think her diffident. I do not see it.”',
			'“My dear Emma,” said he, moving from his chair into one close by\nher, “you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasant\nevening.”',
			'“Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions; and\namused to think how little information I obtained.”',
			'“I am disappointed,” was his only answer.',
			'“I hope every body had a pleasant evening,” said Mr. Woodhouse, in\nhis quiet way. “I had. Once, I felt the fire rather too much; but then I\nmoved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me. Miss\nBates was very chatty and good-humoured, as she always is, though she speaks\nrather too quick. However, she is very agreeable, and Mrs. Bates too, in a\ndifferent way. I like old friends; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort\nof young lady, a very pretty and a very well-behaved young lady indeed. She\nmust have found the evening agreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she had\nEmma.”',
			'“True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax.”',
			'Emma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for the present,\nsaid, and with a sincerity which no one could question—',
			'“She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one’s eyes\nfrom. I am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my\nheart.”',
			'Mr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express; and\nbefore he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse, whose thoughts were on the\nBates’s, said—',
			'“It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined! a\ngreat pity indeed! and I have often wished—but it is so little one can\nventure to do—small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon—Now\nwe have killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg; it is\nvery small and delicate—Hartfield pork is not like any other\npork—but still it is pork—and, my dear Emma, unless one could be\nsure of their making it into steaks, nicely fried, as ours are fried, without\nthe smallest grease, and not roast it, for no stomach can bear roast\npork—I think we had better send the leg—do not you think so, my\ndear?”',
			'“My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it.\nThere will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice, and the\nloin to be dressed directly in any manner they like.”',
			'“That’s right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it before,\nbut that is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it is\nnot over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serle boils ours,\nand eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a little carrot or\nparsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome.”',
			'“Emma,” said Mr. Knightley presently, “I have a piece of news\nfor you. You like news—and I heard an article in my way hither that I\nthink will interest you.”',
			'“News! Oh! yes, I always like news. What is it?—why do you smile\nso?—where did you hear it?—at Randalls?”',
			'He had time only to say,',
			'“No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,” when the door\nwas thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room. Full of\nthanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to give quickest. Mr.\nKnightley soon saw that he had lost his moment, and that not another syllable\nof communication could rest with him.',
			'“Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? My dear Miss\nWoodhouse—I come quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of\npork! You are too bountiful! Have you heard the news? Mr. Elton is going to be\nmarried.”',
			'Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was so completely\nsurprized that she could not avoid a little start, and a little blush, at the\nsound.',
			'“There is my news:—I thought it would interest you,” said Mr.\nKnightley, with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had\npassed between them.',
			'“But where could you hear it?” cried Miss Bates.\n“Where could you possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? For it is not five\nminutes since I received Mrs. Cole’s note—no, it cannot be more\nthan five—or at least ten—for I had got my bonnet and spencer on,\njust ready to come out—I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about\nthe pork—Jane was standing in the passage—were not you,\nJane?—for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting-pan large\nenough. So I said I would go down and see, and Jane said, ‘Shall I go\ndown instead? for I think you have a little cold, and Patty has been washing\nthe kitchen.’—‘Oh! my dear,’ said I—well, and\njust then came the note. A Miss Hawkins—that’s all I know. A Miss\nHawkins of Bath. But, Mr. Knightley, how could you possibly have heard it? for\nthe very moment Mr. Cole told Mrs. Cole of it, she sat down and wrote to me. A\nMiss Hawkins—”',
			'“I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago. He had just read\nElton’s letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to me directly.”',
			'“Well! that is quite—I suppose there never was a piece of news more\ngenerally interesting. My dear sir, you really are too bountiful. My mother\ndesires her very best compliments and regards, and a thousand thanks, and says\nyou really quite oppress her.”',
			'“We consider our Hartfield pork,” replied Mr.\nWoodhouse—“indeed it certainly is, so very superior to all other\npork, that Emma and I cannot have a greater pleasure than—”',
			'“Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good to us.\nIf ever there were people who, without having great wealth themselves, had\nevery thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us. We may well say that\n‘our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.’ Well, Mr. Knightley, and so\nyou actually saw the letter; well—”',
			'“It was short—merely to announce—but cheerful, exulting, of\ncourse.”— Here was a sly glance at Emma. “He had been so\nfortunate as to—I forget the precise words—one has no business to\nremember them. The information was, as you state, that he was going to be\nmarried to a Miss Hawkins. By his style, I should imagine it just\nsettled.”',
			'“Mr. Elton going to be married!” said Emma, as soon as she could\nspeak. “He will have every body’s wishes for his happiness.”',
			'“He is very young to settle,” was Mr. Woodhouse’s\nobservation. “He had better not be in a hurry. He seemed to me very well\noff as he was. We were always glad to see him at Hartfield.”',
			'“A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!” said Miss Bates,\njoyfully; “my mother is so pleased!—she says she cannot bear to\nhave the poor old Vicarage without a mistress. This is great news, indeed.\nJane, you have never seen Mr. Elton!—no wonder that you have such a\ncuriosity to see him.”',
			'Jane’s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to\noccupy her.',
			'“No—I have never seen Mr. Elton,” she replied, starting on\nthis appeal; “is he—is he a tall man?”',
			'“Who shall answer that question?” cried Emma. “My father\nwould say ‘yes,’ Mr. Knightley ‘no;’ and Miss Bates and\nI that he is just the happy medium. When you have been here a little longer,\nMiss Fairfax, you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection\nin Highbury, both in person and mind.”',
			'“Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will. He is the very best young\nman—But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday he was\nprecisely the height of Mr. Perry. Miss Hawkins,—I dare say, an excellent\nyoung woman. His extreme attention to my mother—wanting her to sit in the\nvicarage pew, that she might hear the better, for my mother is a little deaf,\nyou know—it is not much, but she does not hear quite quick. Jane says\nthat Colonel Campbell is a little deaf. He fancied bathing might be good for\nit—the warm bath—but she says it did him no lasting benefit.\nColonel Campbell, you know, is quite our angel. And Mr. Dixon seems a very\ncharming young man, quite worthy of him. It is such a happiness when good\npeople get together—and they always do. Now, here will be Mr. Elton and\nMiss Hawkins; and there are the Coles, such very good people; and the\nPerrys—I suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than Mr.\nand Mrs. Perry. I say, sir,” turning to Mr. Woodhouse, “I think\nthere are few places with such society as Highbury. I always say, we are quite\nblessed in our neighbours.—My dear sir, if there is one thing my mother\nloves better than another, it is pork—a roast loin of pork—”',
			'“As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been acquainted\nwith her,” said Emma, “nothing I suppose can be known. One feels\nthat it cannot be a very long acquaintance. He has been gone only four\nweeks.”',
			'Nobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings, Emma\nsaid,',
			'“You are silent, Miss Fairfax—but I hope you mean to take an\ninterest in this news. You, who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on\nthese subjects, who must have been so deep in the business on Miss\nCampbell’s account—we shall not excuse your being indifferent about\nMr. Elton and Miss Hawkins.”',
			'“When I have seen Mr. Elton,” replied Jane, “I dare say I\nshall be interested—but I believe it requires that with me. And as\nit is some months since Miss Campbell married, the impression may be a little\nworn off.”',
			'“Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss\nWoodhouse,” said Miss Bates, “four weeks yesterday.—A Miss\nHawkins!—Well, I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady\nhereabouts; not that I ever—Mrs. Cole once whispered to me—but I\nimmediately said, ‘No, Mr. Elton is a most worthy young\nman—but’—In short, I do not think I am particularly quick at\nthose sort of discoveries. I do not pretend to it. What is before me, I see. At\nthe same time, nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired—Miss\nWoodhouse lets me chatter on, so good-humouredly. She knows I would not offend\nfor the world. How does Miss Smith do? She seems quite recovered now. Have you\nheard from Mrs. John Knightley lately? Oh! those dear little children. Jane, do\nyou know I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley. I mean in\nperson—tall, and with that sort of look—and not very\ntalkative.”',
			'“Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all.”',
			'“Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand.\nOne takes up a notion, and runs away with it. Mr. Dixon, you say, is not,\nstrictly speaking, handsome?”',
			'“Handsome! Oh! no—far from it—certainly plain. I told you he\nwas plain.”',
			'“My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain,\nand that you yourself—”',
			'“Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing. Where I have a regard, I\nalways think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed the general\nopinion, when I called him plain.”',
			'“Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away. The weather does\nnot look well, and grandmama will be uneasy. You are too obliging, my dear Miss\nWoodhouse; but we really must take leave. This has been a most agreeable piece\nof news indeed. I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole’s; but I shall not\nstop three minutes: and, Jane, you had better go home directly—I would\nnot have you out in a shower!—We think she is the better for Highbury\nalready. Thank you, we do indeed. I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard,\nfor I really do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork: when\nwe dress the leg it will be another thing. Good morning to you, my dear sir.\nOh! Mr. Knightley is coming too. Well, that is so very!—I am sure if Jane\nis tired, you will be so kind as to give her your arm.—Mr. Elton, and\nMiss Hawkins!—Good morning to you.”',
			'Emma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him while he\nlamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry—and to marry\nstrangers too—and the other half she could give to her own view of the\nsubject. It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news, as\nproving that Mr. Elton could not have suffered long; but she was sorry for\nHarriet: Harriet must feel it—and all that she could hope was, by giving\nthe first information herself, to save her from hearing it abruptly from\nothers. It was now about the time that she was likely to call. If she were to\nmeet Miss Bates in her way!—and upon its beginning to rain, Emma was\nobliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at Mrs.\nGoddard’s, and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her\nwithout preparation.',
			'The shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes, when in\ncame Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which hurrying thither with a\nfull heart was likely to give; and the “Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what do you\nthink has happened!” which instantly burst forth, had all the evidence of\ncorresponding perturbation. As the blow was given, Emma felt that she could not\nnow shew greater kindness than in listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran\neagerly through what she had to tell. “She had set out from Mrs.\nGoddard’s half an hour ago—she had been afraid it would\nrain—she had been afraid it would pour down every moment—but she\nthought she might get to Hartfield first—she had hurried on as fast as\npossible; but then, as she was passing by the house where a young woman was\nmaking up a gown for her, she thought she would just step in and see how it\nwent on; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there, soon after\nshe came out it began to rain, and she did not know what to do; so she ran on\ndirectly, as fast as she could, and took shelter at\nFord’s.”—Ford’s was the principal woollen-draper,\nlinen-draper, and haberdasher’s shop united; the shop first in size and\nfashion in the place.—“And so, there she had set, without an idea\nof any thing in the world, full ten minutes, perhaps—when, all of a\nsudden, who should come in—to be sure it was so very odd!—but they\nalways dealt at Ford’s—who should come in, but Elizabeth Martin and\nher brother!—Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think. I thought I should have\nfainted. I did not know what to do. I was sitting near the door—Elizabeth\nsaw me directly; but he did not; he was busy with the umbrella. I am sure she\nsaw me, but she looked away directly, and took no notice; and they both went to\nquite the farther end of the shop; and I kept sitting near the door!—Oh!\ndear; I was so miserable! I am sure I must have been as white as my gown. I\ncould not go away you know, because of the rain; but I did so wish myself\nanywhere in the world but there.—Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse—well, at\nlast, I fancy, he looked round and saw me; for instead of going on with her\nbuyings, they began whispering to one another. I am sure they were talking of\nme; and I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to\nme—(do you think he was, Miss Woodhouse?)—for presently she came\nforward—came quite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to\nshake hands, if I would. She did not do any of it in the same way that she\nused; I could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to try to be\nvery friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time; but I know no\nmore what I said—I was in such a tremble!—I remember she said she\nwas sorry we never met now; which I thought almost too kind! Dear, Miss\nWoodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! By that time, it was beginning to hold\nup, and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting\naway—and then—only think!—I found he was coming up towards me\ntoo—slowly you know, and as if he did not quite know what to do; and so\nhe came and spoke, and I answered—and I stood for a minute, feeling\ndreadfully, you know, one can’t tell how; and then I took courage, and\nsaid it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got three\nyards from the door, when he came after me, only to say, if I was going to\nHartfield, he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole’s stables,\nfor I should find the near way quite floated by this rain. Oh! dear, I thought\nit would have been the death of me! So I said, I was very much obliged to him:\nyou know I could not do less; and then he went back to Elizabeth, and I came\nround by the stables—I believe I did—but I hardly knew where I was,\nor any thing about it. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I would rather done any thing than\nhave it happen: and yet, you know, there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing\nhim behave so pleasantly and so kindly. And Elizabeth, too. Oh! Miss Woodhouse,\ndo talk to me and make me comfortable again.”',
			'Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in her power.\nShe was obliged to stop and think. She was not thoroughly comfortable herself.\nThe young man’s conduct, and his sister’s, seemed the result of\nreal feeling, and she could not but pity them. As Harriet described it, there\nhad been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in\ntheir behaviour. But she had believed them to be well-meaning, worthy people\nbefore; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion? It was\nfolly to be disturbed by it. Of course, he must be sorry to lose her—they\nmust be all sorry. Ambition, as well as love, had probably been mortified. They\nmight all have hoped to rise by Harriet’s acquaintance: and besides, what\nwas the value of Harriet’s description?—So easily pleased—so\nlittle discerning;—what signified her praise?',
			'She exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable, by considering all\nthat had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of being dwelt on,',
			'“It might be distressing, for the moment,” said she; “but you\nseem to have behaved extremely well; and it is over—and may\nnever—can never, as a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need\nnot think about it.”',
			'Harriet said, “very true,” and she “would not think about\nit;” but still she talked of it—still she could talk of nothing\nelse; and Emma, at last, in order to put the Martins out of her head, was\nobliged to hurry on the news, which she had meant to give with so much tender\ncaution; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry, ashamed or only\namused, at such a state of mind in poor Harriet—such a conclusion of Mr.\nElton’s importance with her!',
			'Mr. Elton’s rights, however, gradually revived. Though she did not feel\nthe first intelligence as she might have done the day before, or an hour\nbefore, its interest soon increased; and before their first conversation was\nover, she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity, wonder and\nregret, pain and pleasure, as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins, which could\nconduce to place the Martins under proper subordination in her fancy.',
			'Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting. It had been\nserviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining any influence to\nalarm. As Harriet now lived, the Martins could not get at her, without seeking\nher, where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to\nseek her; for since her refusal of the brother, the sisters never had been at\nMrs. Goddard’s; and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown\ntogether again, with any necessity, or even any power of speech.',

		[
			'Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting\nsituations, that a young person, who either marries or dies, is sure of being\nkindly spoken of.',
			'A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins’s name was first mentioned in\nHighbury, before she was, by some means or other, discovered to have every\nrecommendation of person and mind; to be handsome, elegant, highly\naccomplished, and perfectly amiable: and when Mr. Elton himself arrived to\ntriumph in his happy prospects, and circulate the fame of her merits, there was\nvery little more for him to do, than to tell her Christian name, and say whose\nmusic she principally played.',
			'Mr. Elton returned, a very happy man. He had gone away rejected and\nmortified—disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series of what\nappeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing the right lady, but\nfinding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one. He had gone away\ndeeply offended—he came back engaged to another—and to another as\nsuperior, of course, to the first, as under such circumstances what is gained\nalways is to what is lost. He came back gay and self-satisfied, eager and busy,\ncaring nothing for Miss Woodhouse, and defying Miss Smith.',
			'The charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages of\nperfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent fortune, of so\nmany thousands as would always be called ten; a point of some dignity, as well\nas some convenience: the story told well; he had not thrown himself\naway—he had gained a woman of 10,000 l. or thereabouts; and he had\ngained her with such delightful rapidity—the first hour of introduction\nhad been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice; the history which he\nhad to give Mrs. Cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so\nglorious—the steps so quick, from the accidental rencontre, to the dinner\nat Mr. Green’s, and the party at Mrs. Brown’s—smiles and\nblushes rising in importance—with consciousness and agitation richly\nscattered—the lady had been so easily impressed—so sweetly\ndisposed—had in short, to use a most intelligible phrase, been so very\nready to have him, that vanity and prudence were equally contented.',
			'He had caught both substance and shadow—both fortune and affection, and\nwas just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself and his own\nconcerns—expecting to be congratulated—ready to be laughed\nat—and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing all the young\nladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago, he would have been more\ncautiously gallant.',
			'The wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves to please,\nand nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for; and when he set out for\nBath again, there was a general expectation, which a certain glance of Mrs.\nCole’s did not seem to contradict, that when he next entered Highbury he\nwould bring his bride.',
			'During his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but just enough to\nfeel that the first meeting was over, and to give her the impression of his not\nbeing improved by the mixture of pique and pretension, now spread over his air.\nShe was, in fact, beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him\npleasing at all; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very\ndisagreeable feelings, that, except in a moral light, as a penance, a lesson, a\nsource of profitable humiliation to her own mind, she would have been thankful\nto be assured of never seeing him again. She wished him very well; but he gave\nher pain, and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction.',
			'The pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must certainly be\nlessened by his marriage. Many vain solicitudes would be prevented—many\nawkwardnesses smoothed by it. A Mrs. Elton would be an excuse for\nany change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink without remark. It would\nbe almost beginning their life of civility again.',
			'Of the lady, individually, Emma thought very little. She was good enough for\nMr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for Highbury—handsome\nenough—to look plain, probably, by Harriet’s side. As to connexion,\nthere Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded, that after all his own vaunted claims\nand disdain of Harriet, he had done nothing. On that article, truth seemed\nattainable. What she was, must be uncertain; but who she was,\nmight be found out; and setting aside the 10,000 l., it did not appear that she\nwas at all Harriet’s superior. She brought no name, no blood, no\nalliance. Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a\nBristol—merchant, of course, he must be called; but, as the whole of the\nprofits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate, it was not unfair to\nguess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also. Part of\nevery winter she had been used to spend in Bath; but Bristol was her home, the\nvery heart of Bristol; for though the father and mother had died some years\nago, an uncle remained—in the law line—nothing more distinctly\nhonourable was hazarded of him, than that he was in the law line; and with him\nthe daughter had lived. Emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney, and\ntoo stupid to rise. And all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on\nthe elder sister, who was very well married, to a\ngentleman in a great way, near Bristol, who kept two carriages!\nThat was the wind-up of the history; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins.',
			'Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all! She had talked her\ninto love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be talked out of it. The charm\nof an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet’s mind was not to be\ntalked away. He might be superseded by another; he certainly would indeed;\nnothing could be clearer; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient; but\nnothing else, she feared, would cure her. Harriet was one of those, who, having\nonce begun, would be always in love. And now, poor girl! she was considerably\nworse from this reappearance of Mr. Elton. She was always having a glimpse of\nhim somewhere or other. Emma saw him only once; but two or three times every\nday Harriet was sure just to meet with him, or just to miss him,\njust to hear his voice, or see his shoulder, just to have\nsomething occur to preserve him in her fancy, in all the favouring warmth of\nsurprize and conjecture. She was, moreover, perpetually hearing about him; for,\nexcepting when at Hartfield, she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr.\nElton, and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns; and\nevery report, therefore, every guess—all that had already occurred, all\nthat might occur in the arrangement of his affairs, comprehending income,\nservants, and furniture, was continually in agitation around her. Her regard\nwas receiving strength by invariable praise of him, and her regrets kept alive,\nand feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins’s\nhappiness, and continual observation of, how much he seemed attached!—his\nair as he walked by the house—the very sitting of his hat, being all in\nproof of how much he was in love!',
			'Had it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to her friend, or\nreproach to herself, in the waverings of Harriet’s mind, Emma would have\nbeen amused by its variations. Sometimes Mr. Elton predominated, sometimes the\nMartins; and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other. Mr.\nElton’s engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr.\nMartin. The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a\nlittle put aside by Elizabeth Martin’s calling at Mrs. Goddard’s a\nfew days afterwards. Harriet had not been at home; but a note had been prepared\nand left for her, written in the very style to touch; a small mixture of\nreproach, with a great deal of kindness; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared,\nshe had been much occupied by it, continually pondering over what could be done\nin return, and wishing to do more than she dared to confess. But Mr. Elton, in\nperson, had driven away all such cares. While he staid, the Martins were\nforgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again, Emma, to\ndissipate some of the distress it occasioned, judged it best for her to return\nElizabeth Martin’s visit.',
			'How that visit was to be acknowledged—what would be necessary—and\nwhat might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful consideration. Absolute\nneglect of the mother and sisters, when invited to come, would be ingratitude.\nIt must not be: and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance—!',
			'After much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, than\nHarriet’s returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had\nunderstanding, should convince them that it was to be only a formal\nacquaintance. She meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at the Abbey\nMill, while she drove a little farther, and call for her again so soon, as to\nallow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past,\nand give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the\nfuture.',
			'She could think of nothing better: and though there was something in it which\nher own heart could not approve—something of ingratitude, merely glossed\nover—it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?',
		],
		[
			'Small heart had Harriet for visiting. Only half an hour before her friend\ncalled for her at Mrs. Goddard’s, her evil stars had led her to the very\nspot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to The Rev. Philip Elton,\nWhite-Hart, Bath, was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into\nthe butcher’s cart, which was to convey it to where the coaches past; and\nevery thing in this world, excepting that trunk and the direction, was\nconsequently a blank.',
			'She went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to be put down,\nat the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led between espalier\napple-trees to the front door, the sight of every thing which had given her so\nmuch pleasure the autumn before, was beginning to revive a little local\nagitation; and when they parted, Emma observed her to be looking around with a\nsort of fearful curiosity, which determined her not to allow the visit to\nexceed the proposed quarter of an hour. She went on herself, to give that\nportion of time to an old servant who was married, and settled in Donwell.',
			'The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again; and Miss\nSmith receiving her summons, was with her without delay, and unattended by any\nalarming young man. She came solitarily down the gravel walk—a Miss\nMartin just appearing at the door, and parting with her seemingly with\nceremonious civility.',
			'Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account. She was feeling too\nmuch; but at last Emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of\nmeeting, and the sort of pain it was creating. She had seen only Mrs. Martin\nand the two girls. They had received her doubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing\nbeyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time—till\njust at last, when Mrs. Martin’s saying, all of a sudden, that she\nthought Miss Smith was grown, had brought on a more interesting subject, and a\nwarmer manner. In that very room she had been measured last September, with her\ntwo friends. There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by\nthe window. He had done it. They all seemed to remember the day, the\nhour, the party, the occasion—to feel the same consciousness, the same\nregrets—to be ready to return to the same good understanding; and they\nwere just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma must suspect, as\nready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,) when the carriage\nreappeared, and all was over. The style of the visit, and the shortness of it,\nwere then felt to be decisive. Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom\nshe had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago!—Emma could not\nbut picture it all, and feel how justly they might resent, how naturally\nHarriet must suffer. It was a bad business. She would have given a great deal,\nor endured a great deal, to have had the Martins in a higher rank of life. They\nwere so deserving, that a little higher should have been enough: but as\nit was, how could she have done otherwise?—Impossible!—She could\nnot repent. They must be separated; but there was a great deal of pain in the\nprocess—so much to herself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity\nof a little consolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to\nprocure it. Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins. The\nrefreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.',
			'It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that neither\n“master nor mistress was at home;” they had both been out some\ntime; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield.',
			'“This is too bad,” cried Emma, as they turned away. “And now\nwe shall just miss them; too provoking!—I do not know when I have been so\ndisappointed.” And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge her murmurs,\nor to reason them away; probably a little of both—such being the\ncommonest process of a not ill-disposed mind. Presently the carriage stopt; she\nlooked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who were standing to speak to\nher. There was instant pleasure in the sight of them, and still greater\npleasure was conveyed in sound—for Mr. Weston immediately accosted her\nwith,',
			'“How d’ye do?—how d’ye do?—We have been sitting\nwith your father—glad to see him so well. Frank comes to-morrow—I\nhad a letter this morning—we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a\ncertainty—he is at Oxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I\nknew it would be so. If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three\ndays; I was always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going to have\njust the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather. We shall enjoy him\ncompletely; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish.”',
			'There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the influence of\nsuch a happy face as Mr. Weston’s, confirmed as it all was by the words\nand the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter, but not less to the\npurpose. To know that she thought his coming certain was enough to make\nEmma consider it so, and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy. It was a most\ndelightful reanimation of exhausted spirits. The worn-out past was sunk in the\nfreshness of what was coming; and in the rapidity of half a moment’s\nthought, she hoped Mr. Elton would now be talked of no more.',
			'Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe, which allowed\nhis son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command, as well as the\nroute and the method of his journey; and she listened, and smiled, and\ncongratulated.',
			'“I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield,” said he, at the\nconclusion.',
			'Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from his wife.',
			'“We had better move on, Mr. Weston,” said she, “we are\ndetaining the girls.”',
			'“Well, well, I am ready;”—and turning again to Emma,\n“but you must not be expecting such a very fine young man; you\nhave only had my account you know; I dare say he is really nothing\nextraordinary:”—though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were\nspeaking a very different conviction.',
			'Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer in a manner that\nappropriated nothing.',
			'“Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o’clock,”\nwas Mrs. Weston’s parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant\nonly for her.',
			'“Four o’clock!—depend upon it he will be here by\nthree,” was Mr. Weston’s quick amendment; and so ended a most\nsatisfactory meeting. Emma’s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness;\nevery thing wore a different air; James and his horses seemed not half so\nsluggish as before. When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at\nleast must soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet, she saw\nsomething like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.',
			'“Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as\nOxford?”—was a question, however, which did not augur much.',
			'But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and Emma was now\nin a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.',
			'The morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston’s faithful\npupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve o’clock, that\nshe was to think of her at four.',
			'“My dear, dear anxious friend,”—said she, in mental\nsoliloquy, while walking downstairs from her own room, “always\novercareful for every body’s comfort but your own; I see you now in all\nyour little fidgets, going again and again into his room, to be sure that all\nis right.” The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall.\n“’Tis twelve; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence;\nand by this time to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later, I may be thinking of\nthe possibility of their all calling here. I am sure they will bring him\nsoon.”',
			'She opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with her\nfather—Mr. Weston and his son. They had been arrived only a few minutes,\nand Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of Frank’s being a\nday before his time, and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil\nwelcome and congratulations, when she appeared, to have her share of surprize,\nintroduction, and pleasure.',
			'The Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, was actually before\nher—he was presented to her, and she did not think too much had been said\nin his praise; he was a very good looking young man; height, air,\naddress, all were unexceptionable, and his countenance had a great deal of the\nspirit and liveliness of his father’s; he looked quick and sensible. She\nfelt immediately that she should like him; and there was a well-bred ease of\nmanner, and a readiness to talk, which convinced her that he came intending to\nbe acquainted with her, and that acquainted they soon must be.',
			'He had reached Randalls the evening before. She was pleased with the eagerness\nto arrive which had made him alter his plan, and travel earlier, later, and\nquicker, that he might gain half a day.',
			'“I told you yesterday,” cried Mr. Weston with exultation, “I\ntold you all that he would be here before the time named. I remembered what I\nused to do myself. One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help getting on\nfaster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in upon one’s\nfriends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal more than any little\nexertion it needs.”',
			'“It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,” said the\nyoung man, “though there are not many houses that I should presume on so\nfar; but in coming home I felt I might do any thing.”',
			'The word home made his father look on him with fresh complacency. Emma\nwas directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable; the conviction\nwas strengthened by what followed. He was very much pleased with Randalls,\nthought it a most admirably arranged house, would hardly allow it even to be\nvery small, admired the situation, the walk to Highbury, Highbury itself,\nHartfield still more, and professed himself to have always felt the sort of\ninterest in the country which none but one’s own country gives,\nand the greatest curiosity to visit it. That he should never have been able to\nindulge so amiable a feeling before, passed suspiciously through Emma’s\nbrain; but still, if it were a falsehood, it was a pleasant one, and pleasantly\nhandled. His manner had no air of study or exaggeration. He did really look and\nspeak as if in a state of no common enjoyment.',
			'Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance. On\nhis side were the inquiries,—“Was she a horsewoman?—Pleasant\nrides?—Pleasant walks?—Had they a large\nneighbourhood?—Highbury, perhaps, afforded society enough?—There\nwere several very pretty houses in and about it.—Balls—had they\nballs?—Was it a musical society?”',
			'But when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance proportionably\nadvanced, he contrived to find an opportunity, while their two fathers were\nengaged with each other, of introducing his mother-in-law, and speaking of her\nwith so much handsome praise, so much warm admiration, so much gratitude for\nthe happiness she secured to his father, and her very kind reception of\nhimself, as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please—and of\nhis certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her. He did not advance\na word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston;\nbut, undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter. He understood what\nwould be welcome; he could be sure of little else. “His father’s\nmarriage,” he said, “had been the wisest measure, every friend must\nrejoice in it; and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be\never considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him.”',
			'He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor’s merits,\nwithout seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to\nbe rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse’s\ncharacter, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor’s. And at last, as if resolved\nto qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object, he wound\nit all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person.',
			'“Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,” said he;\n“but I confess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more\nthan a very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know that\nI was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.”',
			'“You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my\nfeelings,” said Emma; “were you to guess her to be eighteen,\nI should listen with pleasure; but she would be ready to quarrel with\nyou for using such words. Don’t let her imagine that you have spoken of\nher as a pretty young woman.”',
			'“I hope I should know better,” he replied; “no, depend upon\nit, (with a gallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand\nwhom I might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my\nterms.”',
			'Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their\nknowing each other, which had taken strong possession of her mind, had ever\ncrossed his; and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of\nacquiescence, or proofs of defiance. She must see more of him to understand his\nways; at present she only felt they were agreeable.',
			'She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about. His quick eye she\ndetected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression; and\neven, when he might have determined not to look, she was confident that he was\noften listening.',
			'Her own father’s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, the\nentire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion, was a\nmost comfortable circumstance. Happily he was not farther from approving\nmatrimony than from foreseeing it.—Though always objecting to every\nmarriage that was arranged, he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension\nof any; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons’\nunderstanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against\nthem. She blessed the favouring blindness. He could now, without the drawback\nof a single unpleasant surmise, without a glance forward at any possible\ntreachery in his guest, give way to all his natural kind-hearted civility in\nsolicitous inquiries after Mr. Frank Churchill’s accommodation on his\njourney, through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road, and express\nvery genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching\ncold—which, however, he could not allow him to feel quite assured of\nhimself till after another night.',
			'A reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.—“He must be\ngoing. He had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many errands for\nMrs. Weston at Ford’s, but he need not hurry any body else.” His\nson, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also, saying,',
			'“As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the opportunity\nof paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other, and therefore may as\nwell be paid now. I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of\nyours, (turning to Emma,) a lady residing in or near Highbury; a family of the\nname of Fairfax. I shall have no difficulty, I suppose, in finding the house;\nthough Fairfax, I believe, is not the proper name—I should rather say\nBarnes, or Bates. Do you know any family of that name?”',
			'“To be sure we do,” cried his father; “Mrs. Bates—we\npassed her house—I saw Miss Bates at the window. True, true, you are\nacquainted with Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine\ngirl she is. Call upon her, by all means.”',
			'“There is no necessity for my calling this morning,” said the young\nman; “another day would do as well; but there was that degree of\nacquaintance at Weymouth which—”',
			'“Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What is right to be done\ncannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank; any want\nof attention to her here should be carefully avoided. You saw her with\nthe Campbells, when she was the equal of every body she mixed with, but here\nshe is with a poor old grandmother, who has barely enough to live on. If you do\nnot call early it will be a slight.”',
			'The son looked convinced.',
			'“I have heard her speak of the acquaintance,” said Emma; “she\nis a very elegant young woman.”',
			'He agreed to it, but with so quiet a “Yes,” as inclined her almost\nto doubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct sort of\nelegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could be thought only\nordinarily gifted with it.',
			'“If you were never particularly struck by her manners before,” said\nshe, “I think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage; see her and\nhear her—no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all, for she has an\naunt who never holds her tongue.”',
			'“You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?” said Mr.\nWoodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation; “then give me\nleave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady. She is\nstaying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt, very worthy people; I have\nknown them all my life. They will be extremely glad to see you, I am sure; and\none of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way.”',
			'“My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct\nme.”',
			'“But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown,\nquite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many houses; you\nmight be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk, unless you keep on\nthe footpath; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the\nstreet.”',
			'Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he could, and his\nfather gave his hearty support by calling out, “My good friend, this is\nquite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it, and as to\nMrs. Bates’s, he may get there from the Crown in a hop, step, and\njump.”',
			'They were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one, and a\ngraceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave. Emma remained very\nwell pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, and could now engage to\nthink of them all at Randalls any hour of the day, with full confidence in\ntheir comfort.',
		],
		[
			'The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again. He came with Mrs. Weston,\nto whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially. He had been sitting\nwith her, it appeared, most companionably at home, till her usual hour of\nexercise; and on being desired to chuse their walk, immediately fixed on\nHighbury.—“He did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in\nevery direction, but if left to him, he should always chuse the same. Highbury,\nthat airy, cheerful, happy-looking Highbury, would be his constant\nattraction.”—Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood for Hartfield; and\nshe trusted to its bearing the same construction with him. They walked thither\ndirectly.',
			'Emma had hardly expected them: for Mr. Weston, who had called in for half a\nminute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome, knew nothing of their\nplans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her, therefore, to perceive them\nwalking up to the house together, arm in arm. She was wanting to see him again,\nand especially to see him in company with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to\nwhom her opinion of him was to depend. If he were deficient there, nothing\nshould make amends for it. But on seeing them together, she became perfectly\nsatisfied. It was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he\npaid his duty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner\nto her—nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as\na friend and securing her affection. And there was time enough for Emma to form\na reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of the morning.\nThey were all three walking about together for an hour or two—first round\nthe shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards in Highbury. He was delighted with\nevery thing; admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse’s ear; and\nwhen their going farther was resolved on, confessed his wish to be made\nacquainted with the whole village, and found matter of commendation and\ninterest much oftener than Emma could have supposed.',
			'Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. He begged to\nbe shewn the house which his father had lived in so long, and which had been\nthe home of his father’s father; and on recollecting that an old woman\nwho had nursed him was still living, walked in quest of her cottage from one\nend of the street to the other; and though in some points of pursuit or\nobservation there was no positive merit, they shewed, altogether, a good-will\ntowards Highbury in general, which must be very like a merit to those he was\nwith.',
			'Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it could\nnot be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself;\nthat he had not been acting a part, or making a parade of insincere\nprofessions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had not done him justice.',
			'Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, though the\nprincipal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of post-horses were kept,\nmore for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road;\nand his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited\nthere; but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added;\nit had been built many years ago for a ball-room, and while the neighbourhood\nhad been in a particularly populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used\nas such;—but such brilliant days had long passed away, and now the\nhighest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club\nestablished among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place. He was\nimmediately interested. Its character as a ball-room caught him; and instead of\npassing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows\nwhich were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities, and lament that\nits original purpose should have ceased. He saw no fault in the room, he would\nacknowledge none which they suggested. No, it was long enough, broad enough,\nhandsome enough. It would hold the very number for comfort. They ought to have\nballs there at least every fortnight through the winter. Why had not Miss\nWoodhouse revived the former good old days of the room?—She who could do\nany thing in Highbury! The want of proper families in the place, and the\nconviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be\ntempted to attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied. He could not be\npersuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him, could not\nfurnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when particulars were given\nand families described, he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience\nof such a mixture would be any thing, or that there would be the smallest\ndifficulty in every body’s returning into their proper place the next\nmorning. He argued like a young man very much bent on dancing; and Emma was\nrather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly\nagainst the habits of the Churchills. He seemed to have all the life and\nspirit, cheerful feelings, and social inclinations of his father, and nothing\nof the pride or reserve of Enscombe. Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps,\nscarcely enough; his indifference to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on\ninelegance of mind. He could be no judge, however, of the evil he was holding\ncheap. It was but an effusion of lively spirits.',
			'At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown; and being now\nalmost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, Emma recollected his intended\nvisit the day before, and asked him if he had paid it.',
			'“Yes, oh! yes”—he replied; “I was just going to mention\nit. A very successful visit:—I saw all the three ladies; and felt very\nmuch obliged to you for your preparatory hint. If the talking aunt had taken me\nquite by surprize, it must have been the death of me. As it was, I was only\nbetrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. Ten minutes would have been all\nthat was necessary, perhaps all that was proper; and I had told my father I\nshould certainly be at home before him—but there was no getting away, no\npause; and, to my utter astonishment, I found, when he (finding me nowhere\nelse) joined me there at last, that I had been actually sitting with them very\nnearly three-quarters of an hour. The good lady had not given me the\npossibility of escape before.”',
			'“And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?”',
			'“Ill, very ill—that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look\nill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it? Ladies can\nnever look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale, as almost\nalways to give the appearance of ill health.—A most deplorable want of\ncomplexion.”',
			'Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax’s\ncomplexion. “It was certainly never brilliant, but she would not allow it\nto have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness and delicacy in her\nskin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face.” He\nlistened with all due deference; acknowledged that he had heard many people say\nthe same—but yet he must confess, that to him nothing could make amends\nfor the want of the fine glow of health. Where features were indifferent, a\nfine complexion gave beauty to them all; and where they were good, the effect\nwas—fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was.',
			'“Well,” said Emma, “there is no disputing about\ntaste.—At least you admire her except her complexion.”',
			'He shook his head and laughed.—“I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and\nher complexion.”',
			'“Did you see her often at Weymouth? Were you often in the same\nsociety?”',
			'At this moment they were approaching Ford’s, and he hastily exclaimed,\n“Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of\ntheir lives, as my father informs me. He comes to Highbury himself, he says,\nsix days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford’s. If it be\nnot inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove myself to belong\nto the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury. I must buy something at\nFord’s. It will be taking out my freedom.—I dare say they sell\ngloves.”',
			'“Oh! yes, gloves and every thing. I do admire your patriotism. You will\nbe adored in Highbury. You were very popular before you came, because you were\nMr. Weston’s son—but lay out half a guinea at Ford’s, and\nyour popularity will stand upon your own virtues.”',
			'They went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of “Men’s\nBeavers” and “York Tan” were bringing down and displaying on\nthe counter, he said—“But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you\nwere speaking to me, you were saying something at the very moment of this burst\nof my amor patriae. Do not let me lose it. I assure you the\nutmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any\nhappiness in private life.”',
			'“I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her party\nat Weymouth.”',
			'“And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be a\nvery unfair one. It is always the lady’s right to decide on the degree of\nacquaintance. Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.—I shall\nnot commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow.”',
			'“Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself. But her\naccount of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she is so very reserved,\nso very unwilling to give the least information about any body, that I really\nthink you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her.”',
			'“May I, indeed?—Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me\nso well. I met her frequently at Weymouth. I had known the Campbells a little\nin town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set. Colonel Campbell is\na very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly, warm-hearted woman. I like\nthem all.”',
			'“You know Miss Fairfax’s situation in life, I conclude; what she is\ndestined to be?”',
			'“Yes—(rather hesitatingly)—I believe I do.”',
			'“You get upon delicate subjects, Emma,” said Mrs. Weston smiling;\n“remember that I am here.—Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows what to\nsay when you speak of Miss Fairfax’s situation in life. I will move a\nlittle farther off.”',
			'“I certainly do forget to think of her,” said Emma,\n“as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest\nfriend.”',
			'He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.',
			'When the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again, “Did\nyou ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?” said Frank\nChurchill.',
			'“Ever hear her!” repeated Emma. “You forget how much she\nbelongs to Highbury. I have heard her every year of our lives since we both\nbegan. She plays charmingly.”',
			'“You think so, do you?—I wanted the opinion of some one who could\nreally judge. She appeared to me to play well, that is, with considerable\ntaste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.—I am excessively fond of\nmusic, but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body’s\nperformance.—I have been used to hear her’s admired; and I remember\none proof of her being thought to play well:—a man, a very musical man,\nand in love with another woman—engaged to her—on the point of\nmarriage—would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the\ninstrument, if the lady in question could sit down instead—never seemed\nto like to hear one if he could hear the other. That, I thought, in a man of\nknown musical talent, was some proof.”',
			'“Proof indeed!” said Emma, highly amused.—“Mr. Dixon is\nvery musical, is he? We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from\nyou, than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.”',
			'“Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a\nvery strong proof.”',
			'“Certainly—very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal\nstronger than, if I had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all\nagreeable to me. I could not excuse a man’s having more music than\nlove—more ear than eye—a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than\nto my feelings. How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?”',
			'“It was her very particular friend, you know.”',
			'“Poor comfort!” said Emma, laughing. “One would rather have a\nstranger preferred than one’s very particular friend—with a\nstranger it might not recur again—but the misery of having a very\nparticular friend always at hand, to do every thing better than one does\noneself!—Poor Mrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in\nIreland.”',
			'“You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but she\nreally did not seem to feel it.”',
			'“So much the better—or so much the worse:—I do not know\nwhich. But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her—quickness of\nfriendship, or dulness of feeling—there was one person, I think, who must\nhave felt it: Miss Fairfax herself. She must have felt the improper and\ndangerous distinction.”',
			'“As to that—I do not—”',
			'“Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax’s\nsensations from you, or from any body else. They are known to no human being, I\nguess, but herself. But if she continued to play whenever she was asked by Mr.\nDixon, one may guess what one chuses.”',
			'“There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them\nall—” he began rather quickly, but checking himself, added,\n“however, it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really\nwere—how it might all be behind the scenes. I can only say that there was\nsmoothness outwardly. But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from a child, must\nbe a better judge of her character, and of how she is likely to conduct herself\nin critical situations, than I can be.”',
			'“I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children and\nwomen together; and it is natural to suppose that we should be\nintimate,—that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited\nher friends. But we never did. I hardly know how it has happened; a little,\nperhaps, from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust\ntowards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was, by her aunt and\ngrandmother, and all their set. And then, her reserve—I never could\nattach myself to any one so completely reserved.”',
			'“It is a most repulsive quality, indeed,” said he.\n“Oftentimes very convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing. There is\nsafety in reserve, but no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person.”',
			'“Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction may\nbe the greater. But I must be more in want of a friend, or an agreeable\ncompanion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble of conquering any\nbody’s reserve to procure one. Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is\nquite out of the question. I have no reason to think ill of her—not the\nleast—except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and\nmanner, such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body, is apt to\nsuggest suspicions of there being something to conceal.”',
			'He perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so long, and thinking\nso much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him, that she could\nhardly believe it to be only their second meeting. He was not exactly what she\nhad expected; less of the man of the world in some of his notions, less of the\nspoiled child of fortune, therefore better than she had expected. His ideas\nseemed more moderate—his feelings warmer. She was particularly struck by\nhis manner of considering Mr. Elton’s house, which, as well as the\nchurch, he would go and look at, and would not join them in finding much fault\nwith. No, he could not believe it a bad house; not such a house as a man was to\nbe pitied for having. If it were to be shared with the woman he loved, he could\nnot think any man to be pitied for having that house. There must be ample room\nin it for every real comfort. The man must be a blockhead who wanted more.',
			'Mrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking about. Used\nonly to a large house himself, and without ever thinking how many advantages\nand accommodations were attached to its size, he could be no judge of the\nprivations inevitably belonging to a small one. But Emma, in her own mind,\ndetermined that he did know what he was talking about, and that he\nshewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life, and to marry, from\nworthy motives. He might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be\noccasioned by no housekeeper’s room, or a bad butler’s pantry, but\nno doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make him happy, and that\nwhenever he were attached, he would willingly give up much of wealth to be\nallowed an early establishment.',
		],
		[
			'Emma’s very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the\nfollowing day, by hearing that he was gone off to London, merely to have his\nhair cut. A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast, and he had\nsent for a chaise and set off, intending to return to dinner, but with no more\nimportant view that appeared than having his hair cut. There was certainly no\nharm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there\nwas an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve. It did\nnot accord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense, or even the\nunselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed herself to discern in him\nyesterday. Vanity, extravagance, love of change, restlessness of temper, which\nmust be doing something, good or bad; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his\nfather and Mrs. Weston, indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in\ngeneral; he became liable to all these charges. His father only called him a\ncoxcomb, and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like\nit, was clear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible, and making\nno other comment than that “all young people would have their little\nwhims.”',
			'With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit hitherto had\ngiven her friend only good ideas of him. Mrs. Weston was very ready to say how\nattentive and pleasant a companion he made himself—how much she saw to\nlike in his disposition altogether. He appeared to have a very open\ntemper—certainly a very cheerful and lively one; she could observe\nnothing wrong in his notions, a great deal decidedly right; he spoke of his\nuncle with warm regard, was fond of talking of him—said he would be the\nbest man in the world if he were left to himself; and though there was no being\nattached to the aunt, he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude, and seemed\nto mean always to speak of her with respect. This was all very promising; and,\nbut for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing to\ndenote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given\nhim; the honour, if not of being really in love with her, of being at least\nvery near it, and saved only by her own indifference—(for still her\nresolution held of never marrying)—the honour, in short, of being marked\nout for her by all their joint acquaintance.',
			'Mr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must have some\nweight. He gave her to understand that Frank admired her\nextremely—thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with so much\nto be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge him harshly. As\nMrs. Weston observed, “all young people would have their little\nwhims.”',
			'There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so leniently\ndisposed. In general he was judged, throughout the parishes of Donwell and\nHighbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were made for the little\nexcesses of such a handsome young man—one who smiled so often and bowed\nso well; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened, from its power\nof censure, by bows or smiles—Mr. Knightley. The circumstance was told\nhim at Hartfield; for the moment, he was silent; but Emma heard him almost\nimmediately afterwards say to himself, over a newspaper he held in his hand,\n“Hum! just the trifling, silly fellow I took him for.” She had half\na mind to resent; but an instant’s observation convinced her that it was\nreally said only to relieve his own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and\ntherefore she let it pass.',
			'Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and Mrs.\nWeston’s visit this morning was in another respect particularly\nopportune. Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make Emma want\ntheir advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted exactly the advice\nthey gave.',
			'This was the occurrence:—The Coles had been settled some years in\nHighbury, and were very good sort of people—friendly, liberal, and\nunpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in trade, and\nonly moderately genteel. On their first coming into the country, they had lived\nin proportion to their income, quietly, keeping little company, and that little\nunexpensively; but the last year or two had brought them a considerable\nincrease of means—the house in town had yielded greater profits, and\nfortune in general had smiled on them. With their wealth, their views\nincreased; their want of a larger house, their inclination for more company.\nThey added to their house, to their number of servants, to their expenses of\nevery sort; and by this time were, in fortune and style of living, second only\nto the family at Hartfield. Their love of society, and their new dining-room,\nprepared every body for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties,\nchiefly among the single men, had already taken place. The regular and best\nfamilies Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite—neither\nDonwell, nor Hartfield, nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt her to go, if\nthey did; and she regretted that her father’s known habits would be\ngiving her refusal less meaning than she could wish. The Coles were very\nrespectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it was not for them\nto arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them. This\nlesson, she very much feared, they would receive only from herself; she had\nlittle hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.',
			'But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before\nit appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her very differently\naffected. Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation, and none had come\nfor her father and herself; and Mrs. Weston’s accounting for it with\n“I suppose they will not take the liberty with you; they know you do not\ndine out,” was not quite sufficient. She felt that she should like to\nhave had the power of refusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be\nassembled there, consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to\nher, occurred again and again, she did not know that she might not have been\ntempted to accept. Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the Bateses.\nThey had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before, and\nFrank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence. Might not the evening\nend in a dance? had been a question of his. The bare possibility of it acted as\na farther irritation on her spirits; and her being left in solitary grandeur,\neven supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment, was but poor\ncomfort.',
			'It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield,\nwhich made their presence so acceptable; for though her first remark, on\nreading it, was that “of course it must be declined,” she so very\nsoon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do, that their advice for\nher going was most prompt and successful.',
			'She owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely without\ninclination for the party. The Coles expressed themselves so\nproperly—there was so much real attention in the manner of it—so\nmuch consideration for her father. “They would have solicited the honour\nearlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from London,\nwhich they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of air, and\ntherefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his\ncompany.” Upon the whole, she was very persuadable; and it being briefly\nsettled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his\ncomfort—how certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates, might be depended\non for bearing him company—Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked into an\nacquiescence of his daughter’s going out to dinner on a day now near at\nhand, and spending the whole evening away from him. As for his going,\nEmma did not wish him to think it possible, the hours would be too late, and\nthe party too numerous. He was soon pretty well resigned.',
			'“I am not fond of dinner-visiting,” said he—“I never\nwas. No more is Emma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs.\nCole should have done it. I think it would be much better if they would come in\none afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us—take us in their\nafternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are so reasonable, and yet\nget home without being out in the damp of the evening. The dews of a summer\nevening are what I would not expose any body to. However, as they are so very\ndesirous to have dear Emma dine with them, and as you will both be there, and\nMr. Knightley too, to take care of her, I cannot wish to prevent it, provided\nthe weather be what it ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy.” Then\nturning to Mrs. Weston, with a look of gentle reproach—“Ah! Miss\nTaylor, if you had not married, you would have staid at home with me.”',
			'“Well, sir,” cried Mr. Weston, “as I took Miss Taylor away,\nit is incumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs.\nGoddard in a moment, if you wish it.”',
			'But the idea of any thing to be done in a moment, was increasing, not\nlessening, Mr. Woodhouse’s agitation. The ladies knew better how to allay\nit. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately arranged.',
			'With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as\nusual. “He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He had a great regard for\nMrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and invite her. James could take\nthe note. But first of all, there must be an answer written to Mrs.\nCole.”',
			'“You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible. You will say\nthat I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must decline their\nobliging invitation; beginning with my compliments, of course. But you\nwill do every thing right. I need not tell you what is to be done. We must\nremember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday. I shall\nhave no fears for you with him. We have never been there above once since the\nnew approach was made; but still I have no doubt that James will take you very\nsafely. And when you get there, you must tell him at what time you would have\nhim come for you again; and you had better name an early hour. You will not\nlike staying late. You will get very tired when tea is over.”',
			'“But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?”',
			'“Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There will be a great many\npeople talking at once. You will not like the noise.”',
			'“But, my dear sir,” cried Mr. Weston, “if Emma comes away\nearly, it will be breaking up the party.”',
			'“And no great harm if it does,” said Mr. Woodhouse. “The\nsooner every party breaks up, the better.”',
			'“But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma’s\ngoing away directly after tea might be giving offence. They are good-natured\npeople, and think little of their own claims; but still they must feel that any\nbody’s hurrying away is no great compliment; and Miss Woodhouse’s\ndoing it would be more thought of than any other person’s in the room.\nYou would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles, I am sure, sir;\nfriendly, good sort of people as ever lived, and who have been your neighbours\nthese ten years.”',
			'“No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged to you\nfor reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain. I\nknow what worthy people they are. Perry tells me that Mr. Cole never touches\nmalt liquor. You would not think it to look at him, but he is bilious—Mr.\nCole is very bilious. No, I would not be the means of giving them any pain. My\ndear Emma, we must consider this. I am sure, rather than run the risk of\nhurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a little longer than you might wish.\nYou will not regard being tired. You will be perfectly safe, you know, among\nyour friends.”',
			'“Oh yes, papa. I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have no\nscruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account. I am only\nafraid of your sitting up for me. I am not afraid of your not being exceedingly\ncomfortable with Mrs. Goddard. She loves piquet, you know; but when she is gone\nhome, I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself, instead of going to bed\nat your usual time—and the idea of that would entirely destroy my\ncomfort. You must promise me not to sit up.”',
			'He did, on the condition of some promises on her side: such as that, if she\ncame home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; if hungry, that\nshe would take something to eat; that her own maid should sit up for her; and\nthat Serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house,\nas usual.',

		[
			'Frank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father’s dinner\nwaiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was too anxious for his\nbeing a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray any imperfection which could be\nconcealed.',
			'He came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with a very good\ngrace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done. He had no\nreason to wish his hair longer, to conceal any confusion of face; no reason to\nwish the money unspent, to improve his spirits. He was quite as undaunted and\nas lively as ever; and, after seeing him, Emma thus moralised to\nherself:—',
			'“I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things do\ncease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way.\nWickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not always folly.—It\ndepends upon the character of those who handle it. Mr. Knightley, he is\nnot a trifling, silly young man. If he were, he would have done this\ndifferently. He would either have gloried in the achievement, or been ashamed\nof it. There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb, or the\nevasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities.—No, I am\nperfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly.”',
			'With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again, and for a longer\ntime than hitherto; of judging of his general manners, and by inference, of the\nmeaning of his manners towards herself; of guessing how soon it might be\nnecessary for her to throw coldness into her air; and of fancying what the\nobservations of all those might be, who were now seeing them together for the\nfirst time.',
			'She meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at Mr.\nCole’s; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr.\nElton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed her more than his\npropensity to dine with Mr. Cole.',
			'Her father’s comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs.\nGoddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty, before she left the\nhouse, was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner; and\nwhile her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress, to make the two\nladies all the amends in her power, by helping them to large slices of cake and\nfull glasses of wine, for whatever unwilling self-denial his care of their\nconstitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal.—She had\nprovided a plentiful dinner for them; she wished she could know that they had\nbeen allowed to eat it.',
			'She followed another carriage to Mr. Cole’s door; and was pleased to see\nthat it was Mr. Knightley’s; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses, having\nlittle spare money and a great deal of health, activity, and independence, was\ntoo apt, in Emma’s opinion, to get about as he could, and not use his\ncarriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey. She had an opportunity\nnow of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart, for he stopped to\nhand her out.',
			'“This is coming as you should do,” said she; “like a\ngentleman.—I am quite glad to see you.”',
			'He thanked her, observing, “How lucky that we should arrive at the same\nmoment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether you would\nhave discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.—You might not\nhave distinguished how I came, by my look or manner.”',
			'“Yes I should, I am sure I should. There is always a look of\nconsciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath\nthem. You think you carry it off very well, I dare say, but with you it is a\nsort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern; I always observe it whenever I\nmeet you under those circumstances. Now you have nothing to try for. You\nare not afraid of being supposed ashamed. You are not striving to look taller\nthan any body else. Now I shall really be very happy to walk into the\nsame room with you.”',
			'“Nonsensical girl!” was his reply, but not at all in anger.',
			'Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with Mr.\nKnightley. She was received with a cordial respect which could not but please,\nand given all the consequence she could wish for. When the Westons arrived, the\nkindest looks of love, the strongest of admiration were for her, from both\nhusband and wife; the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked\nher as his peculiar object, and at dinner she found him seated by\nher—and, as she firmly believed, not without some dexterity on his side.',
			'The party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper\nunobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of naming\namong their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox’s family, the\nlawyer of Highbury. The less worthy females were to come in the evening, with\nMiss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith; but already, at dinner, they were too\nnumerous for any subject of conversation to be general; and, while politics and\nMr. Elton were talked over, Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to\nthe pleasantness of her neighbour. The first remote sound to which she felt\nherself obliged to attend, was the name of Jane Fairfax. Mrs. Cole seemed to be\nrelating something of her that was expected to be very interesting. She\nlistened, and found it well worth listening to. That very dear part of Emma,\nher fancy, received an amusing supply. Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been\ncalling on Miss Bates, and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by\nthe sight of a pianoforte—a very elegant looking instrument—not a\ngrand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the substance of the story, the\nend of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize, and inquiry, and\ncongratulations on her side, and explanations on Miss Bates’s, was, that\nthis pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood’s the day before, to the great\nastonishment of both aunt and niece—entirely unexpected; that at first,\nby Miss Bates’s account, Jane herself was quite at a loss, quite\nbewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it—but now, they were\nboth perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter;—of\ncourse it must be from Colonel Campbell.',
			'“One can suppose nothing else,” added Mrs. Cole, “and I was\nonly surprized that there could ever have been a doubt. But Jane, it seems, had\na letter from them very lately, and not a word was said about it. She knows\ntheir ways best; but I should not consider their silence as any reason for\ntheir not meaning to make the present. They might chuse to surprize her.”',
			'Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the subject was\nequally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell, and equally rejoiced\nthat such a present had been made; and there were enough ready to speak to\nallow Emma to think her own way, and still listen to Mrs. Cole.',
			'“I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me\nmore satisfaction!—It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax, who\nplays so delightfully, should not have an instrument. It seemed quite a shame,\nespecially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are\nabsolutely thrown away. This is like giving ourselves a slap, to be sure! and\nit was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole, I really was ashamed to look at\nour new grand pianoforte in the drawing-room, while I do not know one note from\nanother, and our little girls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never\nmake any thing of it; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music,\nhas not any thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest old\nspinet in the world, to amuse herself with.—I was saying this to Mr. Cole\nbut yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he is so particularly fond of\nmusic that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase, hoping that\nsome of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a\nbetter use than we can; and that really is the reason why the instrument was\nbought—or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.—We are in\ngreat hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this\nevening.”',
			'Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing more was\nto be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole’s, turned to Frank\nChurchill.',
			'“Why do you smile?” said she.',
			'“Nay, why do you?”',
			'“Me!—I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell’s\nbeing so rich and so liberal.—It is a handsome present.”',
			'“Very.”',
			'“I rather wonder that it was never made before.”',
			'“Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before.”',
			'“Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument—which\nmust now be shut up in London, untouched by any body.”',
			'“That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large for Mrs.\nBates’s house.”',
			'“You may say what you chuse—but your countenance testifies\nthat your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine.”',
			'“I do not know. I rather believe you are giving me more credit for\nacuteness than I deserve. I smile because you smile, and shall probably suspect\nwhatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what there is to\nquestion. If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can be?”',
			'“What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?”',
			'“Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon. She must\nknow as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument would be; and perhaps\nthe mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a young woman’s\nscheme than an elderly man’s. It is Mrs. Dixon, I dare say. I told you\nthat your suspicions would guide mine.”',
			'“If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend Mr. Dixon\nin them.”',
			'“Mr. Dixon.—Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must be\nthe joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. We were speaking the other day, you\nknow, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance.”',
			'“Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I had\nentertained before.—I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of\neither Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help suspecting either that,\nafter making his proposals to her friend, he had the misfortune to fall in love\nwith her, or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her\nside. One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right; but I\nam sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury\ninstead of going with the Campbells to Ireland. Here, she must be leading a\nlife of privation and penance; there it would have been all enjoyment. As to\nthe pretence of trying her native air, I look upon that as a mere\nexcuse.—In the summer it might have passed; but what can any body’s\nnative air do for them in the months of January, February, and March? Good\nfires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate\nhealth, and I dare say in her’s. I do not require you to adopt all my\nsuspicions, though you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly\ntell you what they are.”',
			'“And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr.\nDixon’s preference of her music to her friend’s, I can answer for\nbeing very decided.”',
			'“And then, he saved her life. Did you ever hear of that?—A water\nparty; and by some accident she was falling overboard. He caught her.”',
			'“He did. I was there—one of the party.”',
			'“Were you really?—Well!—But you observed nothing of course,\nfor it seems to be a new idea to you.—If I had been there, I think I\nshould have made some discoveries.”',
			'“I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact, that\nMiss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caught\nher.—It was the work of a moment. And though the consequent shock and\nalarm was very great and much more durable—indeed I believe it was half\nan hour before any of us were comfortable again—yet that was too general\na sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable. I do not mean\nto say, however, that you might not have made discoveries.”',
			'The conversation was here interrupted. They were called on to share in the\nawkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses, and obliged to be as\nformal and as orderly as the others; but when the table was again safely\ncovered, when every corner dish was placed exactly right, and occupation and\nease were generally restored, Emma said,',
			'“The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me. I wanted to know a\nlittle more, and this tells me quite enough. Depend upon it, we shall soon hear\nthat it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.”',
			'“And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must\nconclude it to come from the Campbells.”',
			'“No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells. Miss Fairfax knows it is not\nfrom the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first. She would not\nhave been puzzled, had she dared fix on them. I may not have convinced you\nperhaps, but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in\nthe business.”',
			'“Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced. Your reasonings\ncarry my judgment along with them entirely. At first, while I supposed you\nsatisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw it only as paternal\nkindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the world. But when you\nmentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more probable that it should be the\ntribute of warm female friendship. And now I can see it in no other light than\nas an offering of love.”',
			'There was no occasion to press the matter farther. The conviction seemed real;\nhe looked as if he felt it. She said no more, other subjects took their turn;\nand the rest of the dinner passed away; the dessert succeeded, the children\ncame in, and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation; a\nfew clever things said, a few downright silly, but by much the larger\nproportion neither the one nor the other—nothing worse than everyday\nremarks, dull repetitions, old news, and heavy jokes.',
			'The ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other ladies, in\ntheir different divisions, arrived. Emma watched the entree of her own\nparticular little friend; and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace,\nshe could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner, but\ncould most heartily rejoice in that light, cheerful, unsentimental disposition\nwhich allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs\nof disappointed affection. There she sat—and who would have guessed how\nmany tears she had been lately shedding? To be in company, nicely dressed\nherself and seeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty, and\nsay nothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour. Jane Fairfax did\nlook and move superior; but Emma suspected she might have been glad to change\nfeelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased the mortification of having\nloved—yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton in vain—by the surrender\nof all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her\nfriend.',
			'In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her. She did\nnot wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much in the secret herself,\nto think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair, and therefore purposely\nkept at a distance; but by the others, the subject was almost immediately\nintroduced, and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations\nwere received, the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of “my\nexcellent friend Colonel Campbell.”',
			'Mrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested by the\ncircumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in\ndwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone,\ntouch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about\nit as possible, which she plainly read in the fair heroine’s countenance.',
			'They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of the early\nwas Frank Churchill. In he walked, the first and the handsomest; and after\npaying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and her niece, made his way\ndirectly to the opposite side of the circle, where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till\nhe could find a seat by her, would not sit at all. Emma divined what every body\npresent must be thinking. She was his object, and every body must perceive it.\nShe introduced him to her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient moments\nafterwards, heard what each thought of the other. “He had never seen so\nlovely a face, and was delighted with her naïveté.” And she, “Only\nto be sure it was paying him too great a compliment, but she did think there\nwere some looks a little like Mr. Elton.” Emma restrained her\nindignation, and only turned from her in silence.',
			'Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing\ntowards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech. He told her that\nhe had been impatient to leave the dining-room—hated sitting\nlong—was always the first to move when he could—that his father,\nMr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left very busy over parish\nbusiness—that as long as he had staid, however, it had been pleasant\nenough, as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike, sensible men;\nand spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether—thought it so abundant in\nagreeable families—that Emma began to feel she had been used to despise\nthe place rather too much. She questioned him as to the society in\nYorkshire—the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort;\nand could make out from his answers that, as far as Enscombe was concerned,\nthere was very little going on, that their visitings were among a range of\ngreat families, none very near; and that even when days were fixed, and\ninvitations accepted, it was an even chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in\nhealth and spirits for going; that they made a point of visiting no fresh\nperson; and that, though he had his separate engagements, it was not without\ndifficulty, without considerable address at times, that he could\nget away, or introduce an acquaintance for a night.',
			'She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury, taken at its best,\nmight reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he\nliked. His importance at Enscombe was very evident. He did not boast, but it\nnaturally betrayed itself, that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could\ndo nothing, and on her laughing and noticing it, he owned that he believed\n(excepting one or two points) he could with time persuade her to\nany thing. One of those points on which his influence failed, he then\nmentioned. He had wanted very much to go abroad—had been very eager\nindeed to be allowed to travel—but she would not hear of it. This had\nhappened the year before. Now, he said, he was beginning to have no\nlonger the same wish.',
			'The unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed to be good\nbehaviour to his father.',
			'“I have made a most wretched discovery,” said he, after a short\npause.— “I have been here a week to-morrow—half my time. I\nnever knew days fly so fast. A week to-morrow!—And I have hardly begun to\nenjoy myself. But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!—I\nhate the recollection.”',
			'“Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day, out of\nso few, in having your hair cut.”',
			'“No,” said he, smiling, “that is no subject of regret at all.\nI have no pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself fit to be\nseen.”',
			'The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself obliged to\nturn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole. When Mr. Cole had\nmoved away, and her attention could be restored as before, she saw Frank\nChurchill looking intently across the room at Miss Fairfax, who was sitting\nexactly opposite.',
			'“What is the matter?” said she.',
			'He started. “Thank you for rousing me,” he replied. “I\nbelieve I have been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so\nodd a way—so very odd a way—that I cannot keep my eyes from her. I\nnever saw any thing so outrée!—Those curls!—This must be a fancy of\nher own. I see nobody else looking like her!—I must go and ask her\nwhether it is an Irish fashion. Shall I?—Yes, I will—I declare I\nwill—and you shall see how she takes it;—whether she\ncolours.”',
			'He was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss Fairfax,\nand talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady, as he had\nimprovidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly in front of Miss\nFairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.',
			'Before he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.',
			'“This is the luxury of a large party,” said she:—“one\ncan get near every body, and say every thing. My dear Emma, I am longing to\ntalk to you. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like\nyourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh. Do you know how Miss\nBates and her niece came here?”',
			'“How?—They were invited, were not they?”',
			'“Oh! yes—but how they were conveyed hither?—the manner of\ntheir coming?”',
			'“They walked, I conclude. How else could they come?”',
			'“Very true.—Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad\nit would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night, and cold as\nthe nights are now. And as I looked at her, though I never saw her appear to\nmore advantage, it struck me that she was heated, and would therefore be\nparticularly liable to take cold. Poor girl! I could not bear the idea of it;\nso, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room, and I could get at him, I spoke\nto him about the carriage. You may guess how readily he came into my wishes;\nand having his approbation, I made my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her\nthat the carriage would be at her service before it took us home; for I thought\nit would be making her comfortable at once. Good soul! she was as grateful as\npossible, you may be sure. ‘Nobody was ever so fortunate as\nherself!’—but with many, many thanks—‘there was no\noccasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley’s carriage had brought, and was\nto take them home again.’ I was quite surprized;—very glad, I am\nsure; but really quite surprized. Such a very kind attention—and so\nthoughtful an attention!—the sort of thing that so few men would think\nof. And, in short, from knowing his usual ways, I am very much inclined to\nthink that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all. I do\nsuspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself, and that it was\nonly as an excuse for assisting them.”',
			'“Very likely,” said Emma—“nothing more likely. I know\nno man more likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing—to do any\nthing really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He is not a\ngallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering Jane\nFairfax’s ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;—and\nfor an act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on more\nthan on Mr. Knightley. I know he had horses to-day—for we arrived\ntogether; and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word that could\nbetray.”',
			'“Well,” said Mrs. Weston, smiling, “you give him credit for\nmore simple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for while\nMiss Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I have never been\nable to get it out again. The more I think of it, the more probable it appears.\nIn short, I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax. See the\nconsequence of keeping you company!—What do you say to it?”',
			'“Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!” exclaimed Emma. “Dear Mrs.\nWeston, how could you think of such a thing?—Mr. Knightley!—Mr.\nKnightley must not marry!—You would not have little Henry cut out from\nDonwell?—Oh! no, no, Henry must have Donwell. I cannot at all consent to\nMr. Knightley’s marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely. I am\namazed that you should think of such a thing.”',
			'“My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it. I do not want\nthe match—I do not want to injure dear little Henry—but the idea\nhas been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley really wished to\nmarry, you would not have him refrain on Henry’s account, a boy of six\nyears old, who knows nothing of the matter?”',
			'“Yes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.—Mr.\nKnightley marry!—No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adopt it\nnow. And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!”',
			'“Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you very well\nknow.”',
			'“But the imprudence of such a match!”',
			'“I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.”',
			'“I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than\nwhat you mention. His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you, would be quite\nenough to account for the horses. He has a great regard for the Bateses, you\nknow, independent of Jane Fairfax—and is always glad to shew them\nattention. My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take to match-making. You do it very\nill. Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!—Oh! no, no;—every feeling\nrevolts. For his own sake, I would not have him do so mad a thing.”',
			'“Imprudent, if you please—but not mad. Excepting inequality of\nfortune, and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing\nunsuitable.”',
			'“But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. I am sure he has not the least\nidea of it. Do not put it into his head. Why should he marry?—He is as\nhappy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep, and his library,\nand all the parish to manage; and he is extremely fond of his brother’s\nchildren. He has no occasion to marry, either to fill up his time or his\nheart.”',
			'“My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really loves\nJane Fairfax—”',
			'“Nonsense! He does not care about Jane Fairfax. In the way of love, I am\nsure he does not. He would do any good to her, or her family; but—”',
			'“Well,” said Mrs. Weston, laughing, “perhaps the greatest\ngood he could do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.”',
			'“If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself; a\nvery shameful and degrading connexion. How would he bear to have Miss Bates\nbelonging to him?—To have her haunting the Abbey, and thanking him all\nday long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?—‘So very kind and\nobliging!—But he always had been such a very kind neighbour!’ And\nthen fly off, through half a sentence, to her mother’s old petticoat.\n‘Not that it was such a very old petticoat either—for still it\nwould last a great while—and, indeed, she must thankfully say that their\npetticoats were all very strong.’”',
			'“For shame, Emma! Do not mimic her. You divert me against my conscience.\nAnd, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed by Miss\nBates. Little things do not irritate him. She might talk on; and if he wanted\nto say any thing himself, he would only talk louder, and drown her voice. But\nthe question is not, whether it would be a bad connexion for him, but whether\nhe wishes it; and I think he does. I have heard him speak, and so must you, so\nvery highly of Jane Fairfax! The interest he takes in her—his anxiety\nabout her health—his concern that she should have no happier prospect! I\nhave heard him express himself so warmly on those points!—Such an admirer\nof her performance on the pianoforte, and of her voice! I have heard him say\nthat he could listen to her for ever. Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea\nthat occurred to me—this pianoforte that has been sent here by\nsomebody—though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a\npresent from the Campbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley? I cannot help\nsuspecting him. I think he is just the person to do it, even without being in\nlove.”',
			'“Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love. But I do not\nthink it is at all a likely thing for him to do. Mr. Knightley does nothing\nmysteriously.”',
			'“I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly; oftener\nthan I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common course of\nthings, occur to him.”',
			'“Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have told\nher so.”',
			'“There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma. I have a very strong\nnotion that it comes from him. I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs.\nCole told us of it at dinner.”',
			'“You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have many\na time reproached me with doing. I see no sign of attachment—I believe\nnothing of the pianoforte—and proof only shall convince me that Mr.\nKnightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.”',
			'They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather gaining\nground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston was the most used of the\ntwo to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over,\nand the instrument in preparation;—and at the same moment Mr. Cole\napproaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it.\nFrank Churchill, of whom, in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs.\nWeston, she had been seeing nothing, except that he had found a seat by Miss\nFairfax, followed Mr. Cole, to add his very pressing entreaties; and as, in\nevery respect, it suited Emma best to lead, she gave a very proper compliance.',
			'She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she\ncould perform with credit; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little\nthings which are generally acceptable, and could accompany her own voice well.\nOne accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize—a second,\nslightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill. Her pardon was duly begged at\nthe close of the song, and every thing usual followed. He was accused of having\na delightful voice, and a perfect knowledge of music; which was properly\ndenied; and that he knew nothing of the matter, and had no voice at all,\nroundly asserted. They sang together once more; and Emma would then resign her\nplace to Miss Fairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental, she\nnever could attempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely superior to her\nown.',
			'With mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers\nround the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill sang again. They had sung\ntogether once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth. But the sight of Mr.\nKnightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half Emma’s mind; and\nshe fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs. Weston’s\nsuspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary\ninterruptions. Her objections to Mr. Knightley’s marrying did not in the\nleast subside. She could see nothing but evil in it. It would be a great\ndisappointment to Mr. John Knightley; consequently to Isabella. A real injury\nto the children—a most mortifying change, and material loss to them\nall;—a very great deduction from her father’s daily\ncomfort—and, as to herself, she could not at all endure the idea of Jane\nFairfax at Donwell Abbey. A Mrs. Knightley for them all to give way\nto!—No—Mr. Knightley must never marry. Little Henry must remain the\nheir of Donwell.',
			'Presently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her. They talked\nat first only of the performance. His admiration was certainly very warm; yet\nshe thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would not have struck her. As a sort of\ntouchstone, however, she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt\nand niece; and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short,\nshe believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of\nhis own.',
			'“I often feel concern,” said she, “that I dare not make our\ncarriage more useful on such occasions. It is not that I am without the wish;\nbut you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put-to\nfor such a purpose.”',
			'“Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,” he\nreplied;—“but you must often wish it, I am sure.” And he\nsmiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed\nanother step.',
			'“This present from the Campbells,” said she—“this\npianoforte is very kindly given.”',
			'“Yes,” he replied, and without the smallest apparent\nembarrassment.—“But they would have done better had they given her\nnotice of it. Surprizes are foolish things. The pleasure is not enhanced, and\nthe inconvenience is often considerable. I should have expected better judgment\nin Colonel Campbell.”',
			'From that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley had had no\nconcern in giving the instrument. But whether he were entirely free from\npeculiar attachment—whether there were no actual\npreference—remained a little longer doubtful. Towards the end of\nJane’s second song, her voice grew thick.',
			'“That will do,” said he, when it was finished, thinking\naloud—“you have sung quite enough for one evening—now be\nquiet.”',
			'Another song, however, was soon begged for. “One more;—they would\nnot fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one\nmore.” And Frank Churchill was heard to say, “I think you could\nmanage this without effort; the first part is so very trifling. The strength of\nthe song falls on the second.”',
			'Mr. Knightley grew angry.',
			'“That fellow,” said he, indignantly, “thinks of nothing but\nshewing off his own voice. This must not be.” And touching Miss Bates,\nwho at that moment passed near—“Miss Bates, are you mad, to let\nyour niece sing herself hoarse in this manner? Go, and interfere. They have no\nmercy on her.”',
			'Miss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even to be\ngrateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing. Here\nceased the concert part of the evening, for Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax\nwere the only young lady performers; but soon (within five minutes) the\nproposal of dancing—originating nobody exactly knew where—was so\neffectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that every thing was rapidly\nclearing away, to give proper space. Mrs. Weston, capital in her\ncountry-dances, was seated, and beginning an irresistible waltz; and Frank\nChurchill, coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma, had secured her\nhand, and led her up to the top.',
			'While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off, Emma found\ntime, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste,\nto look about, and see what became of Mr. Knightley. This would be a trial. He\nwas no dancer in general. If he were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax\nnow, it might augur something. There was no immediate appearance. No; he was\ntalking to Mrs. Cole—he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by\nsomebody else, and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.',
			'Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe; and she led\noff the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. Not more than five couple\ncould be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very\ndelightful, and she found herself well matched in a partner. They were a couple\nworth looking at.',
			'Two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. It was growing late,\nand Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on her mother’s account. After\nsome attempts, therefore, to be permitted to begin again, they were obliged to\nthank Mrs. Weston, look sorrowful, and have done.',
			'“Perhaps it is as well,” said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emma\nto her carriage. “I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languid dancing\nwould not have agreed with me, after yours.”',
		],
		[
			'Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles. The visit afforded\nher many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that she might be\nsupposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion, must be amply repaid\nin the splendour of popularity. She must have delighted the Coles—worthy\npeople, who deserved to be made happy!—And left a name behind her that\nwould not soon die away.',
			'Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were two points on\nwhich she was not quite easy. She doubted whether she had not transgressed the\nduty of woman by woman, in betraying her suspicions of Jane Fairfax’s\nfeelings to Frank Churchill. It was hardly right; but it had been so strong an\nidea, that it would escape her, and his submission to all that she told, was a\ncompliment to her penetration, which made it difficult for her to be quite\ncertain that she ought to have held her tongue.',
			'The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; and there she\nhad no doubt. She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of\nher own playing and singing. She did most heartily grieve over the idleness of\nher childhood—and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half.',
			'She was then interrupted by Harriet’s coming in; and if Harriet’s\npraise could have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.',
			'“Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!”',
			'“Don’t class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like\nher’s, than a lamp is like sunshine.”',
			'“Oh! dear—I think you play the best of the two. I think you play\nquite as well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every body\nlast night said how well you played.”',
			'“Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. The\ntruth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised, but Jane\nFairfax’s is much beyond it.”',
			'“Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, or\nthat if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr. Cole said\nhow much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your\ntaste, and that he valued taste much more than execution.”',
			'“Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.”',
			'“Are you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did not know she had any\ntaste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing.—There is no\nunderstanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play so very well, you know,\nit is no more than she is obliged to do, because she will have to teach. The\nCoxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family.\nHow did you think the Coxes looked?”',
			'“Just as they always do—very vulgar.”',
			'“They told me something,” said Harriet rather hesitatingly;\n“but it is nothing of any consequence.”',
			'Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful of its producing\nMr. Elton.',
			'“They told me—that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday.”',
			'“Oh!”',
			'“He came to their father upon some business, and he asked him to stay to\ndinner.”',
			'“Oh!”',
			'“They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox. I do not know\nwhat she meant, but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again\nnext summer.”',
			'“She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox should\nbe.”',
			'“She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there. He sat by her at\ndinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry\nhim.”',
			'“Very likely.—I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar\ngirls in Highbury.”',
			'Harriet had business at Ford’s.—Emma thought it most prudent to go\nwith her. Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible, and in her\npresent state, would be dangerous.',
			'Harriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always very long\nat a purchase; and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her\nmind, Emma went to the door for amusement.—Much could not be hoped from\nthe traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;—Mr. Perry walking\nhastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the office-door, Mr.\nCole’s carriage-horses returning from exercise, or a stray letter-boy on\nan obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect; and\nwhen her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray, a tidy old woman\ntravelling homewards from shop with her full basket, two curs quarrelling over\na dirty bone, and a string of dawdling children round the baker’s little\nbow-window eyeing the gingerbread, she knew she had no reason to complain, and\nwas amused enough; quite enough still to stand at the door. A mind lively and\nat ease, can do with seeing nothing, and can see nothing that does not answer.',
			'She looked down the Randalls road. The scene enlarged; two persons appeared;\nMrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were walking into Highbury;—to\nHartfield of course. They were stopping, however, in the first place at Mrs.\nBates’s; whose house was a little nearer Randalls than Ford’s; and\nhad all but knocked, when Emma caught their eye.—Immediately they crossed\nthe road and came forward to her; and the agreeableness of yesterday’s\nengagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting. Mrs. Weston\ninformed her that she was going to call on the Bateses, in order to hear the\nnew instrument.',
			'“For my companion tells me,” said she, “that I absolutely\npromised Miss Bates last night, that I would come this morning. I was not aware\nof it myself. I did not know that I had fixed a day, but as he says I did, I am\ngoing now.”',
			'“And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,”\nsaid Frank Churchill, “to join your party and wait for her at\nHartfield—if you are going home.”',
			'Mrs. Weston was disappointed.',
			'“I thought you meant to go with me. They would be very much\npleased.”',
			'“Me! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps—I may be equally in\nthe way here. Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me. My aunt always\nsends me off when she is shopping. She says I fidget her to death; and Miss\nWoodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same. What am I to do?”',
			'“I am here on no business of my own,” said Emma; “I am only\nwaiting for my friend. She will probably have soon done, and then we shall go\nhome. But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument.”',
			'“Well—if you advise it.—But (with a smile) if Colonel\nCampbell should have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to have\nan indifferent tone—what shall I say? I shall be no support to Mrs.\nWeston. She might do very well by herself. A disagreeable truth would be\npalatable through her lips, but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a\ncivil falsehood.”',
			'“I do not believe any such thing,” replied Emma.—“I am\npersuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is\nnecessary; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent.\nQuite otherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax’s opinion last\nnight.”',
			'“Do come with me,” said Mrs. Weston, “if it be not very\ndisagreeable to you. It need not detain us long. We will go to Hartfield\nafterwards. We will follow them to Hartfield. I really wish you to call with\nme. It will be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you meant\nit.”',
			'He could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him, returned\nwith Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates’s door. Emma watched them in, and then\njoined Harriet at the interesting counter,—trying, with all the force of\nher own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use\nto look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be it ever so beautiful, would\nstill never match her yellow pattern. At last it was all settled, even to the\ndestination of the parcel.',
			'“Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard’s, ma’am?” asked Mrs.\nFord.—“Yes—no—yes, to Mrs. Goddard’s. Only my\npattern gown is at Hartfield. No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you\nplease. But then, Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.—And I could take the\npattern gown home any day. But I shall want the ribbon directly—so it had\nbetter go to Hartfield—at least the ribbon. You could make it into two\nparcels, Mrs. Ford, could not you?”',
			'“It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two\nparcels.”',
			'“No more it is.”',
			'“No trouble in the world, ma’am,” said the obliging Mrs.\nFord.',
			'“Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one. Then, if you\nplease, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard’s—I do not\nknow—No, I think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent to\nHartfield, and take it home with me at night. What do you advise?”',
			'“That you do not give another half-second to the subject. To Hartfield,\nif you please, Mrs. Ford.”',
			'“Aye, that will be much best,” said Harriet, quite satisfied,\n“I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard’s.”',
			'Voices approached the shop—or rather one voice and two ladies: Mrs.\nWeston and Miss Bates met them at the door.',
			'“My dear Miss Woodhouse,” said the latter, “I am just run\nacross to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little\nwhile, and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith. How\ndo you do, Miss Smith?—Very well I thank you.—And I begged Mrs.\nWeston to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.”',
			'“I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are—”',
			'“Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully well; and\nJane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?—I am so glad to\nhear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here.—Oh! then,\nsaid I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run\nacross and entreat her to come in; my mother will be so very happy to see\nher—and now we are such a nice party, she cannot\nrefuse.—‘Aye, pray do,’ said Mr. Frank Churchill, ‘Miss\nWoodhouse’s opinion of the instrument will be worth\nhaving.’—But, said I, I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of\nyou will go with me.—‘Oh,’ said he, ‘wait half a\nminute, till I have finished my job;’—For, would you believe it,\nMiss Woodhouse, there he is, in the most obliging manner in the world,\nfastening in the rivet of my mother’s spectacles.—The rivet came\nout, you know, this morning.—So very obliging!—For my mother had no\nuse of her spectacles—could not put them on. And, by the bye, every body\nought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed. Jane said so. I meant\nto take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did, but something or\nother hindered me all the morning; first one thing, then another, there is no\nsaying what, you know. At one time Patty came to say she thought the kitchen\nchimney wanted sweeping. Oh, said I, Patty do not come with your bad news to\nme. Here is the rivet of your mistress’s spectacles out. Then the baked\napples came home, Mrs. Wallis sent them by her boy; they are extremely civil\nand obliging to us, the Wallises, always—I have heard some people say\nthat Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never\nknown any thing but the greatest attention from them. And it cannot be for the\nvalue of our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread, you know? Only\nthree of us.—besides dear Jane at present—and she really eats\nnothing—makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened if\nyou saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she eats—so I say\none thing and then I say another, and it passes off. But about the middle of\nthe day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked\napples, and they are extremely wholesome, for I took the opportunity the other\nday of asking Mr. Perry; I happened to meet him in the street. Not that I had\nany doubt before—I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked\napple. I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit\nthoroughly wholesome. We have apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes\nan excellent apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and\nthese ladies will oblige us.”',
			'Emma would be “very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c.,” and they\ndid at last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss Bates than,',
			'“How do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see you before. I\nhear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town. Jane came back\ndelighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do very well—only a little too\nlarge about the wrist; but Jane is taking them in.”',
			'“What was I talking of?” said she, beginning again when they were\nall in the street.',
			'Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.',
			'“I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.—Oh! my\nmother’s spectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill!\n‘Oh!’ said he, ‘I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a\njob of this kind excessively.’—Which you know shewed him to be so\nvery.... Indeed I must say that, much as I had heard of him before and much as\nI had expected, he very far exceeds any thing.... I do congratulate you, Mrs.\nWeston, most warmly. He seems every thing the fondest parent could....\n‘Oh!’ said he, ‘I can fasten the rivet. I like a job of that\nsort excessively.’ I never shall forget his manner. And when I brought\nout the baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very\nobliging as to take some, ‘Oh!’ said he directly, ‘there is\nnothing in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking\nhome-baked apples I ever saw in my life.’ That, you know, was so very....\nAnd I am sure, by his manner, it was no compliment. Indeed they are very\ndelightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice—only we do not\nhave them baked more than twice, and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them\ndone three times—but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it.\nThe apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all\nfrom Donwell—some of Mr. Knightley’s most liberal supply. He sends\nus a sack every year; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple\nanywhere as one of his trees—I believe there is two of them. My mother\nsays the orchard was always famous in her younger days. But I was really quite\nshocked the other day—for Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was\neating these apples, and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed\nthem, and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock. ‘I am\nsure you must be,’ said he, ‘and I will send you another supply;\nfor I have a great many more than I can ever use. William Larkins let me keep a\nlarger quantity than usual this year. I will send you some more, before they\nget good for nothing.’ So I begged he would not—for really as to\nours being gone, I could not absolutely say that we had a great many\nleft—it was but half a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept for\nJane; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more, so liberal\nas he had been already; and Jane said the same. And when he was gone, she\nalmost quarrelled with me—No, I should not say quarrelled, for we never\nhad a quarrel in our lives; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the\napples were so nearly gone; she wished I had made him believe we had a great\nmany left. Oh, said I, my dear, I did say as much as I could. However, the very\nsame evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same\nsort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged, and went down\nand spoke to William Larkins and said every thing, as you may suppose. William\nLarkins is such an old acquaintance! I am always glad to see him. But, however,\nI found afterwards from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of\nthat sort his master had; he had brought them all—and now his\nmaster had not one left to bake or boil. William did not seem to mind it\nhimself, he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for William,\nyou know, thinks more of his master’s profit than any thing; but Mrs.\nHodges, he said, was quite displeased at their being all sent away. She could\nnot bear that her master should not be able to have another apple-tart this\nspring. He told Patty this, but bid her not mind it, and be sure not to say any\nthing to us about it, for Mrs. Hodges would be cross sometimes, and as\nlong as so many sacks were sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder. And\nso Patty told me, and I was excessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr.\nKnightley know any thing about it for the world! He would be so very.... I\nwanted to keep it from Jane’s knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned\nit before I was aware.”',
			'Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors walked\nupstairs without having any regular narration to attend to, pursued only by the\nsounds of her desultory good-will.',
			'“Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning. Pray take\ncare, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase—rather darker and\nnarrower than one could wish. Miss Smith, pray take care. Miss Woodhouse, I am\nquite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot. Miss Smith, the step at the\nturning.”',

			'The appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, was tranquillity\nitself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment, slumbering on one side of\nthe fire, Frank Churchill, at a table near her, most deedily occupied about her\nspectacles, and Jane Fairfax, standing with her back to them, intent on her\npianoforte.',
			'Busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most happy\ncountenance on seeing Emma again.',
			'“This is a pleasure,” said he, in rather a low voice, “coming\nat least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated. You find me trying to be\nuseful; tell me if you think I shall succeed.”',
			'“What!” said Mrs. Weston, “have not you finished it yet? you\nwould not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this\nrate.”',
			'“I have not been working uninterruptedly,” he replied, “I\nhave been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand\nsteadily, it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe. You see\nwe have been wedging one leg with paper. This was very kind of you to be\npersuaded to come. I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home.”',
			'He contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently employed in\nlooking out the best baked apple for her, and trying to make her help or advise\nhim in his work, till Jane Fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the\npianoforte again. That she was not immediately ready, Emma did suspect to arise\nfrom the state of her nerves; she had not yet possessed the instrument long\nenough to touch it without emotion; she must reason herself into the power of\nperformance; and Emma could not but pity such feelings, whatever their origin,\nand could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again.',
			'At last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, the powers of\nthe instrument were gradually done full justice to. Mrs. Weston had been\ndelighted before, and was delighted again; Emma joined her in all her praise;\nand the pianoforte, with every proper discrimination, was pronounced to be\naltogether of the highest promise.',
			'“Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ,” said Frank Churchill, with\na smile at Emma, “the person has not chosen ill. I heard a good deal of\nColonel Campbell’s taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the upper notes\nI am sure is exactly what he and all that party would\nparticularly prize. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave his friend\nvery minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself. Do not you think\nso?”',
			'Jane did not look round. She was not obliged to hear. Mrs. Weston had been\nspeaking to her at the same moment.',
			'“It is not fair,” said Emma, in a whisper; “mine was a random\nguess. Do not distress her.”',
			'He shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little doubt and\nvery little mercy. Soon afterwards he began again,',
			'“How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this\noccasion, Miss Fairfax. I dare say they often think of you, and wonder which\nwill be the day, the precise day of the instrument’s coming to hand. Do\nyou imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going forward just at\nthis time?—Do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate\ncommission from him, or that he may have sent only a general direction, an\norder indefinite as to time, to depend upon contingencies and\nconveniences?”',
			'He paused. She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,',
			'“Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell,” said she, in a voice\nof forced calmness, “I can imagine nothing with any confidence. It must\nbe all conjecture.”',
			'“Conjecture—aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes one\nconjectures wrong. I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this rivet\nquite firm. What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse, when hard at work, if one\ntalks at all;—your real workmen, I suppose, hold their tongues; but we\ngentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word—Miss Fairfax said something\nabout conjecturing. There, it is done. I have the pleasure, madam, (to Mrs.\nBates,) of restoring your spectacles, healed for the present.”',
			'He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape a little from\nthe latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged Miss Fairfax, who was still\nsitting at it, to play something more.',
			'“If you are very kind,” said he, “it will be one of the\nwaltzes we danced last night;—let me live them over again. You did not\nenjoy them as I did; you appeared tired the whole time. I believe you were glad\nwe danced no longer; but I would have given worlds—all the worlds one\never has to give—for another half-hour.”',
			'She played.',
			'“What felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one\nhappy!—If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth.”',
			'She looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played something else.\nHe took some music from a chair near the pianoforte, and turning to Emma, said,',
			'“Here is something quite new to me. Do you know\nit?—Cramer.—And here are a new set of Irish melodies. That, from\nsuch a quarter, one might expect. This was all sent with the instrument. Very\nthoughtful of Colonel Campbell, was not it?—He knew Miss Fairfax could\nhave no music here. I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews\nit to have been so thoroughly from the heart. Nothing hastily done; nothing\nincomplete. True affection only could have prompted it.”',
			'Emma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused; and when\non glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the remains of a smile,\nwhen she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness, there had been a\nsmile of secret delight, she had less scruple in the amusement, and much less\ncompunction with respect to her.—This amiable, upright, perfect Jane\nFairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings.',
			'He brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.—Emma\ntook the opportunity of whispering,',
			'“You speak too plain. She must understand you.”',
			'“I hope she does. I would have her understand me. I am not in the least\nashamed of my meaning.”',
			'“But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the\nidea.”',
			'“I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me. I have now a\nkey to all her odd looks and ways. Leave shame to her. If she does wrong, she\nought to feel it.”',
			'“She is not entirely without it, I think.”',
			'“I do not see much sign of it. She is playing Robin Adair\nat this moment—his favourite.”',
			'Shortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window, descried Mr. Knightley\non horse-back not far off.',
			'“Mr. Knightley I declare!—I must speak to him if possible, just to\nthank him. I will not open the window here; it would give you all cold; but I\ncan go into my mother’s room you know. I dare say he will come in when he\nknows who is here. Quite delightful to have you all meet so!—Our little\nroom so honoured!”',
			'She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening the\ncasement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley’s attention, and every\nsyllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others, as if it\nhad passed within the same apartment.',
			'“How d’ ye do?—how d’ye do?—Very well, I thank\nyou. So obliged to you for the carriage last night. We were just in time; my\nmother just ready for us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some friends\nhere.”',
			'So began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in his\nturn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,',
			'“How is your niece, Miss Bates?—I want to inquire after you all,\nbut particularly your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?—I hope she caught no\ncold last night. How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is.”',
			'And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in\nany thing else. The listeners were amused; and Mrs. Weston gave Emma a look of\nparticular meaning. But Emma still shook her head in steady scepticism.',
			'“So obliged to you!—so very much obliged to you for the\ncarriage,” resumed Miss Bates.',
			'He cut her short with,',
			'“I am going to Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?”',
			'“Oh! dear, Kingston—are you?—Mrs. Cole was saying the other\nday she wanted something from Kingston.”',
			'“Mrs. Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing for\nyou?”',
			'“No, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?—Miss\nWoodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte. Do put\nup your horse at the Crown, and come in.”',
			'“Well,” said he, in a deliberating manner, “for five minutes,\nperhaps.”',
			'“And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!—Quite\ndelightful; so many friends!”',
			'“No, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two minutes. I must get on to\nKingston as fast as I can.”',
			'“Oh! do come in. They will be so very happy to see you.”',
			'“No, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, and hear the\npianoforte.”',
			'“Well, I am so sorry!—Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party\nlast night; how extremely pleasant.—Did you ever see such\ndancing?—Was not it delightful?—Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank\nChurchill; I never saw any thing equal to it.”',
			'“Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose Miss\nWoodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes. And\n(raising his voice still more) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be\nmentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax dances very well; and Mrs. Weston is the\nvery best country-dance player, without exception, in England. Now, if your\nfriends have any gratitude, they will say something pretty loud about you and\nme in return; but I cannot stay to hear it.”',
			'“Oh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence—so\nshocked!—Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!”',
			'“What is the matter now?”',
			'“To think of your sending us all your store apples. You said you had a\ngreat many, and now you have not one left. We really are so shocked! Mrs.\nHodges may well be angry. William Larkins mentioned it here. You should not\nhave done it, indeed you should not. Ah! he is off. He never can bear to be\nthanked. But I thought he would have staid now, and it would have been a pity\nnot to have mentioned.... Well, (returning to the room,) I have not been able\nto succeed. Mr. Knightley cannot stop. He is going to Kingston. He asked me if\nhe could do any thing....”',
			'“Yes,” said Jane, “we heard his kind offers, we heard every\nthing.”',
			'“Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door was\nopen, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud. You must have\nheard every thing to be sure. ‘Can I do any thing for you at\nKingston?’ said he; so I just mentioned.... Oh! Miss Woodhouse, must you\nbe going?—You seem but just come—so very obliging of you.”',
			'Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lasted long; and\non examining watches, so much of the morning was perceived to be gone, that\nMrs. Weston and her companion taking leave also, could allow themselves only to\nwalk with the two young ladies to Hartfield gates, before they set off for\nRandalls.',

		[
			'It may be possible to do without dancing entirely. Instances have been known of\nyoung people passing many, many months successively, without being at any ball\nof any description, and no material injury accrue either to body or\nmind;—but when a beginning is made—when the felicities of rapid\nmotion have once been, though slightly, felt—it must be a very heavy set\nthat does not ask for more.',
			'Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again; and the\nlast half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to spend with\nhis daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young people in schemes on the\nsubject. Frank’s was the first idea; and his the greatest zeal in\npursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties, and the most\nsolicitous for accommodation and appearance. But still she had inclination\nenough for shewing people again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss\nWoodhouse danced—for doing that in which she need not blush to compare\nherself with Jane Fairfax—and even for simple dancing itself, without any\nof the wicked aids of vanity—to assist him first in pacing out the room\nthey were in to see what it could be made to hold—and then in taking the\ndimensions of the other parlour, in the hope of discovering, in spite of all\nthat Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size, that it was a little the\nlargest.',
			'His first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole’s\nshould be finished there—that the same party should be collected, and the\nsame musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence. Mr. Weston entered\ninto the idea with thorough enjoyment, and Mrs. Weston most willingly undertook\nto play as long as they could wish to dance; and the interesting employment had\nfollowed, of reckoning up exactly who there would be, and portioning out the\nindispensable division of space to every couple.',
			'“You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss\nCoxes five,” had been repeated many times over. “And there will be\nthe two Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides Mr. Knightley. Yes,\nthat will be quite enough for pleasure. You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax,\nwill be three, and the two Miss Coxes five; and for five couple there will be\nplenty of room.”',
			'But soon it came to be on one side,',
			'“But will there be good room for five couple?—I really do not think\nthere will.”',
			'On another,',
			'“And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth while to\nstand up. Five couple are nothing, when one thinks seriously about it. It will\nnot do to invite five couple. It can be allowable only as the thought of\nthe moment.”',
			'Somebody said that Miss Gilbert was expected at her brother’s, and\nmust be invited with the rest. Somebody else believed Mrs. Gilbert would\nhave danced the other evening, if she had been asked. A word was put in for a\nsecond young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston naming one family of cousins who must\nbe included, and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out, it\nbecame a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten, and a very\ninteresting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of.',
			'The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other. “Might not they\nuse both rooms, and dance across the passage?” It seemed the best scheme;\nand yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better. Emma said it\nwould be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in distress about the supper; and Mr.\nWoodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the score of health. It made him so very\nunhappy, indeed, that it could not be persevered in.',
			'“Oh! no,” said he; “it would be the extreme of imprudence. I\ncould not bear it for Emma!—Emma is not strong. She would catch a\ndreadful cold. So would poor little Harriet. So you would all. Mrs. Weston, you\nwould be quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing. Pray do not\nlet them talk of it. That young man (speaking lower) is very thoughtless. Do\nnot tell his father, but that young man is not quite the thing. He has been\nopening the doors very often this evening, and keeping them open very\ninconsiderately. He does not think of the draught. I do not mean to set you\nagainst him, but indeed he is not quite the thing!”',
			'Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge. She knew the importance of it, and\nsaid every thing in her power to do it away. Every door was now closed, the\npassage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they\nwere in resorted to again; and with such good-will on Frank Churchill’s\npart, that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely\nsufficient for five couple, was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for\nten.',
			'“We were too magnificent,” said he. “We allowed unnecessary\nroom. Ten couple may stand here very well.”',
			'Emma demurred. “It would be a crowd—a sad crowd; and what could be\nworse than dancing without space to turn in?”',
			'“Very true,” he gravely replied; “it was very bad.” But\nstill he went on measuring, and still he ended with,',
			'“I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.”',
			'“No, no,” said she, “you are quite unreasonable. It would be\ndreadful to be standing so close! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to\nbe dancing in a crowd—and a crowd in a little room!”',
			'“There is no denying it,” he replied. “I agree with you\nexactly. A crowd in a little room—Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of\ngiving pictures in a few words. Exquisite, quite exquisite!—Still,\nhowever, having proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up. It\nwould be a disappointment to my father—and altogether—I do not know\nthat—I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very\nwell.”',
			'Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self-willed, and\nthat he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her; but she\ntook the compliment, and forgave the rest. Had she intended ever to\nmarry him, it might have been worth while to pause and consider, and try\nto understand the value of his preference, and the character of his temper; but\nfor all the purposes of their acquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.',
			'Before the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and he entered the room\nwith such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme. It\nsoon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.',
			'“Well, Miss Woodhouse,” he almost immediately began, “your\ninclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the\nterrors of my father’s little rooms. I bring a new proposal on the\nsubject:—a thought of my father’s, which waits only your\napprobation to be acted upon. May I hope for the honour of your hand for the\ntwo first dances of this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls,\nbut at the Crown Inn?”',
			'“The Crown!”',
			'“Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot,\nmy father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there. Better\naccommodations, he can promise them, and not a less grateful welcome than at\nRandalls. It is his own idea. Mrs. Weston sees no objection to it, provided you\nare satisfied. This is what we all feel. Oh! you were perfectly right! Ten\ncouple, in either of the Randalls rooms, would have been\ninsufferable!—Dreadful!—I felt how right you were the whole time,\nbut was too anxious for securing any thing to like to yield. Is\nnot it a good exchange?—You consent—I hope you consent?”',
			'“It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs.\nWeston do not. I think it admirable; and, as far as I can answer for myself,\nshall be most happy—It seems the only improvement that could be. Papa, do\nyou not think it an excellent improvement?”',
			'She was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully comprehended; and\nthen, being quite new, farther representations were necessary to make it\nacceptable.',
			'“No; he thought it very far from an improvement—a very bad\nplan—much worse than the other. A room at an inn was always damp and\ndangerous; never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited. If they must dance,\nthey had better dance at Randalls. He had never been in the room at the Crown\nin his life—did not know the people who kept it by sight.—Oh!\nno—a very bad plan. They would catch worse colds at the Crown than\nanywhere.”',
			'“I was going to observe, sir,” said Frank Churchill, “that\none of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger\nof any body’s catching cold—so much less danger at the Crown than\nat Randalls! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but nobody\nelse could.”',
			'“Sir,” said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, “you are very much\nmistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character. Mr. Perry is\nextremely concerned when any of us are ill. But I do not understand how the\nroom at the Crown can be safer for you than your father’s house.”',
			'“From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. We shall have no\noccasion to open the windows at all—not once the whole evening; and it is\nthat dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon heated\nbodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief.”',
			'“Open the windows!—but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think of\nopening the windows at Randalls. Nobody could be so imprudent! I never heard of\nsuch a thing. Dancing with open windows!—I am sure, neither your father\nnor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would suffer it.”',
			'“Ah! sir—but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind\na window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. I have\noften known it done myself.”',
			'“Have you indeed, sir?—Bless me! I never could have supposed it.\nBut I live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear. However,\nthis does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk it\nover—but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration. One\ncannot resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging\nas to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see what can be\ndone.”',
			'“But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited—”',
			'“Oh!” interrupted Emma, “there will be plenty of time for\ntalking every thing over. There is no hurry at all. If it can be contrived to\nbe at the Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses. They will be\nso near their own stable.”',
			'“So they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not that James ever\ncomplains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can. If I could be sure\nof the rooms being thoroughly aired—but is Mrs. Stokes to be trusted? I\ndoubt it. I do not know her, even by sight.”',
			'“I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will be\nunder Mrs. Weston’s care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the\nwhole.”',
			'“There, papa!—Now you must be satisfied—Our own dear Mrs.\nWeston, who is carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, so\nmany years ago, when I had the measles? ‘If Miss Taylor\nundertakes to wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.’ How\noften have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!”',
			'“Aye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it. Poor\nlittle Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you would have been\nvery bad, but for Perry’s great attention. He came four times a day for a\nweek. He said, from the first, it was a very good sort—which was our\ngreat comfort; but the measles are a dreadful complaint. I hope whenever poor\nIsabella’s little ones have the measles, she will send for Perry.”',
			'“My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,” said\nFrank Churchill, “examining the capabilities of the house. I left them\nthere and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you\nmight be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot. I was desired\nto say so from both. It would be the greatest pleasure to them, if you could\nallow me to attend you there. They can do nothing satisfactorily without\nyou.”',
			'Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father, engaging to\nthink it all over while she was gone, the two young people set off together\nwithout delay for the Crown. There were Mr. and Mrs. Weston; delighted to see\nher and receive her approbation, very busy and very happy in their different\nway; she, in some little distress; and he, finding every thing perfect.',
			'“Emma,” said she, “this paper is worse than I expected. Look!\nin places you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and\nforlorn than any thing I could have imagined.”',
			'“My dear, you are too particular,” said her husband. “What\ndoes all that signify? You will see nothing of it by candlelight. It will be as\nclean as Randalls by candlelight. We never see any thing of it on our\nclub-nights.”',
			'The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, “Men never know\nwhen things are dirty or not;” and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to\nhimself, “Women will have their little nonsenses and needless\ncares.”',
			'One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain. It\nregarded a supper-room. At the time of the ballroom’s being built,\nsuppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, was the only\naddition. What was to be done? This card-room would be wanted as a card-room\nnow; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves,\nstill was it not too small for any comfortable supper? Another room of much\nbetter size might be secured for the purpose; but it was at the other end of\nthe house, and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it. This\nmade a difficulty. Mrs. Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in\nthat passage; and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of\nbeing miserably crowded at supper.',
			'Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches, &c., set\nout in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion. A\nprivate dance, without sitting down to supper, was pronounced an infamous fraud\nupon the rights of men and women; and Mrs. Weston must not speak of it again.\nShe then took another line of expediency, and looking into the doubtful room,\nobserved,',
			'“I do not think it is so very small. We shall not be many, you\nknow.”',
			'And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps through the\npassage, was calling out,',
			'“You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear. It is a\nmere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs.”',
			'“I wish,” said Mrs. Weston, “one could know which arrangement\nour guests in general would like best. To do what would be most generally\npleasing must be our object—if one could but tell what that would\nbe.”',
			'“Yes, very true,” cried Frank, “very true. You want your\nneighbours’ opinions. I do not wonder at you. If one could ascertain what\nthe chief of them—the Coles, for instance. They are not far off. Shall I\ncall upon them? Or Miss Bates? She is still nearer.—And I do not know\nwhether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest\nof the people as any body. I think we do want a larger council. Suppose I go\nand invite Miss Bates to join us?”',
			'“Well—if you please,” said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating,\n“if you think she will be of any use.”',
			'“You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,” said Emma.\n“She will be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing.\nShe will not even listen to your questions. I see no advantage in consulting\nMiss Bates.”',
			'“But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing! I am very fond of hearing\nMiss Bates talk. And I need not bring the whole family, you know.”',
			'Here Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed, gave it his\ndecided approbation.',
			'“Aye, do, Frank.—Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter\nat once. She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know a properer\nperson for shewing us how to do away difficulties. Fetch Miss Bates. We are\ngrowing a little too nice. She is a standing lesson of how to be happy. But\nfetch them both. Invite them both.”',
			'“Both sir! Can the old lady?”...',
			'“The old lady! No, the young lady, to be sure. I shall think you a great\nblockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.”',
			'“Oh! I beg your pardon, sir. I did not immediately recollect. Undoubtedly\nif you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both.” And away he ran.',
			'Long before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving aunt, and\nher elegant niece,—Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered woman and a good\nwife, had examined the passage again, and found the evils of it much less than\nshe had supposed before—indeed very trifling; and here ended the\ndifficulties of decision. All the rest, in speculation at least, was perfectly\nsmooth. All the minor arrangements of table and chair, lights and music, tea\nand supper, made themselves; or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any\ntime between Mrs. Weston and Mrs. Stokes.—Every body invited, was\ncertainly to come; Frank had already written to Enscombe to propose staying a\nfew days beyond his fortnight, which could not possibly be refused. And a\ndelightful dance it was to be.',
			'Most cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she agree that it must. As a\ncounsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much safer character,)\nshe was truly welcome. Her approbation, at once general and minute, warm and\nincessant, could not but please; and for another half-hour they were all\nwalking to and fro, between the different rooms, some suggesting, some\nattending, and all in happy enjoyment of the future. The party did not break up\nwithout Emma’s being positively secured for the two first dances by the\nhero of the evening, nor without her overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his\nwife, “He has asked her, my dear. That’s right. I knew he\nwould!”',
		],
		[
			'One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely\nsatisfactory to Emma—its being fixed for a day within the granted term of\nFrank Churchill’s stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr. Weston’s\nconfidence, she could not think it so very impossible that the Churchills might\nnot allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight. But this was not\njudged feasible. The preparations must take their time, nothing could be\nproperly ready till the third week were entered on, and for a few days they\nmust be planning, proceeding and hoping in uncertainty—at the\nrisk—in her opinion, the great risk, of its being all in vain.',
			'Enscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word. His wish of\nstaying longer evidently did not please; but it was not opposed. All was safe\nand prosperous; and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for\nanother, Emma, being now certain of her ball, began to adopt as the next\nvexation Mr. Knightley’s provoking indifference about it. Either because\nhe did not dance himself, or because the plan had been formed without his being\nconsulted, he seemed resolved that it should not interest him, determined\nagainst its exciting any present curiosity, or affording him any future\namusement. To her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving\nreply, than,',
			'“Very well. If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble\nfor a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to say against it, but\nthat they shall not chuse pleasures for me.—Oh! yes, I must be there; I\ncould not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as I can; but I would rather be\nat home, looking over William Larkins’s week’s account; much\nrather, I confess.—Pleasure in seeing dancing!—not I,\nindeed—I never look at it—I do not know who does.—Fine\ndancing, I believe, like virtue, must be its own reward. Those who are standing\nby are usually thinking of something very different.”',
			'This Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry. It was not in\ncompliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent, or so indignant;\nhe was not guided by her feelings in reprobating the ball, for\nshe enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree. It made her\nanimated—open hearted—she voluntarily said;—',
			'“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball. What\na disappointment it would be! I do look forward to it, I own, with very\ngreat pleasure.”',
			'It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the\nsociety of William Larkins. No!—she was more and more convinced that Mrs.\nWeston was quite mistaken in that surmise. There was a great deal of friendly\nand of compassionate attachment on his side—but no love.',
			'Alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley. Two days of\njoyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of every thing. A\nletter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge his nephew’s instant return.\nMrs. Churchill was unwell—far too unwell to do without him; she had been\nin a very suffering state (so said her husband) when writing to her nephew two\ndays before, though from her usual unwillingness to give pain, and constant\nhabit of never thinking of herself, she had not mentioned it; but now she was\ntoo ill to trifle, and must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay.',
			'The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note from Mrs. Weston,\ninstantly. As to his going, it was inevitable. He must be gone within a few\nhours, though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt, to lessen his\nrepugnance. He knew her illnesses; they never occurred but for her own\nconvenience.',
			'Mrs. Weston added, “that he could only allow himself time to hurry to\nHighbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends there whom he\ncould suppose to feel any interest in him; and that he might be expected at\nHartfield very soon.”',
			'This wretched note was the finale of Emma’s breakfast. When once it had\nbeen read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim. The loss of\nthe ball—the loss of the young man—and all that the young man might\nbe feeling!—It was too wretched!—Such a delightful evening as it\nwould have been!—Every body so happy! and she and her partner the\nhappiest!—“I said it would be so,” was the only consolation.',
			'Her father’s feelings were quite distinct. He thought principally of Mrs.\nChurchill’s illness, and wanted to know how she was treated; and as for\nthe ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed; but they would all be\nsafer at home.',
			'Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared; but if this\nreflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful look and total want of\nspirits when he did come might redeem him. He felt the going away almost too\nmuch to speak of it. His dejection was most evident. He sat really lost in\nthought for the first few minutes; and when rousing himself, it was only to\nsay,',
			'“Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.”',
			'“But you will come again,” said Emma. “This will not be your\nonly visit to Randalls.”',
			'“Ah!—(shaking his head)—the uncertainty of when I may be able\nto return!—I shall try for it with a zeal!—It will be the object of\nall my thoughts and cares!—and if my uncle and aunt go to town this\nspring—but I am afraid—they did not stir last spring—I am\nafraid it is a custom gone for ever.”',
			'“Our poor ball must be quite given up.”',
			'“Ah! that ball!—why did we wait for any thing?—why not seize\nthe pleasure at once?—How often is happiness destroyed by preparation,\nfoolish preparation!—You told us it would be so.—Oh! Miss\nWoodhouse, why are you always so right?”',
			'“Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance. I would much\nrather have been merry than wise.”',
			'“If I can come again, we are still to have our ball. My father depends on\nit. Do not forget your engagement.”',
			'Emma looked graciously.',
			'“Such a fortnight as it has been!” he continued; “every day\nmore precious and more delightful than the day before!—every day making\nme less fit to bear any other place. Happy those, who can remain at\nHighbury!”',
			'“As you do us such ample justice now,” said Emma, laughing,\n“I will venture to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at\nfirst? Do not we rather surpass your expectations? I am sure we do. I am sure\nyou did not much expect to like us. You would not have been so long in coming,\nif you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury.”',
			'He laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment, Emma was\nconvinced that it had been so.',
			'“And you must be off this very morning?”',
			'“Yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, and I\nmust be off immediately. I am almost afraid that every moment will bring\nhim.”',
			'“Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss\nBates? How unlucky! Miss Bates’s powerful, argumentative mind might have\nstrengthened yours.”',
			'“Yes—I have called there; passing the door, I thought it\nbetter. It was a right thing to do. I went in for three minutes, and was\ndetained by Miss Bates’s being absent. She was out; and I felt it\nimpossible not to wait till she came in. She is a woman that one may, that one\nmust laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. It was better to\npay my visit, then”—',
			'He hesitated, got up, walked to a window.',
			'“In short,” said he, “perhaps, Miss Woodhouse—I think\nyou can hardly be quite without suspicion”—',
			'He looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts. She hardly knew what to\nsay. It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious, which she\ndid not wish. Forcing herself to speak, therefore, in the hope of putting it\nby, she calmly said,',
			'“You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit,\nthen”—',
			'He was silent. She believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting on what\nshe had said, and trying to understand the manner. She heard him sigh. It was\nnatural for him to feel that he had cause to sigh. He could not believe\nher to be encouraging him. A few awkward moments passed, and he sat down again;\nand in a more determined manner said,',
			'“It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to\nHartfield. My regard for Hartfield is most warm”—',
			'He stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.—He was more in\nlove with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might have ended,\nif his father had not made his appearance? Mr. Woodhouse soon followed; and the\nnecessity of exertion made him composed.',
			'A very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial. Mr. Weston,\nalways alert when business was to be done, and as incapable of procrastinating\nany evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any that was doubtful, said,\n“It was time to go;” and the young man, though he might and did\nsigh, could not but agree, to take leave.',
			'“I shall hear about you all,” said he; “that is my chief\nconsolation. I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you. I have\nengaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me. She has been so kind as to promise\nit. Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when one is really interested\nin the absent!—she will tell me every thing. In her letters I shall be at\ndear Highbury again.”',
			'A very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest “Good-bye,”\nclosed the speech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill. Short had\nbeen the notice—short their meeting; he was gone; and Emma felt so sorry\nto part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence\nas to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling it too much.',
			'It was a sad change. They had been meeting almost every day since his arrival.\nCertainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit to the last two\nweeks—indescribable spirit; the idea, the expectation of seeing him which\nevery morning had brought, the assurance of his attentions, his liveliness, his\nmanners! It had been a very happy fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking\nfrom it into the common course of Hartfield days. To complete every other\nrecommendation, he had almost told her that he loved her. What strength,\nor what constancy of affection he might be subject to, was another point; but\nat present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration, a\nconscious preference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to all the rest,\nmade her think that she must be a little in love with him, in spite of\nevery previous determination against it.',
			'“I certainly must,” said she. “This sensation of\nlistlessness, weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ\nmyself, this feeling of every thing’s being dull and insipid about the\nhouse!— I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world\nif I were not—for a few weeks at least. Well! evil to some is always good\nto others. I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball, if not for Frank\nChurchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy. He may spend the evening with his\ndear William Larkins now if he likes.”',
			'Mr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness. He could not say that\nhe was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look would have contradicted\nhim if he had; but he said, and very steadily, that he was sorry for the\ndisappointment of the others, and with considerable kindness added,',
			'“You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really out\nof luck; you are very much out of luck!”',
			'It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her honest regret in\nthis woeful change; but when they did meet, her composure was odious. She had\nbeen particularly unwell, however, suffering from headache to a degree, which\nmade her aunt declare, that had the ball taken place, she did not think Jane\ncould have attended it; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming\nindifference to the languor of ill-health.',
		],
		[
			'Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love. Her ideas only\nvaried as to the how much. At first, she thought it was a good deal; and\nafterwards, but little. She had great pleasure in hearing Frank Churchill\ntalked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure than ever in seeing Mr. and Mrs.\nWeston; she was very often thinking of him, and quite impatient for a letter,\nthat she might know how he was, how were his spirits, how was his aunt, and\nwhat was the chance of his coming to Randalls again this spring. But, on the\nother hand, she could not admit herself to be unhappy, nor, after the first\nmorning, to be less disposed for employment than usual; she was still busy and\ncheerful; and, pleasing as he was, she could yet imagine him to have faults;\nand farther, though thinking of him so much, and, as she sat drawing or\nworking, forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their\nattachment, fancying interesting dialogues, and inventing elegant letters; the\nconclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she\nrefused him. Their affection was always to subside into\nfriendship. Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting; but\nstill they were to part. When she became sensible of this, it struck her that\nshe could not be very much in love; for in spite of her previous and fixed\ndetermination never to quit her father, never to marry, a strong attachment\ncertainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own\nfeelings.',
			'“I do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice,”\nsaid she.—“In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate\nnegatives, is there any allusion to making a sacrifice. I do suspect that he is\nnot really necessary to my happiness. So much the better. I certainly will not\npersuade myself to feel more than I do. I am quite enough in love. I should be\nsorry to be more.”',
			'Upon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his feelings.',
			'“He is undoubtedly very much in love—every thing denotes\nit—very much in love indeed!—and when he comes again, if his\naffection continue, I must be on my guard not to encourage it.—It would\nbe most inexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up. Not that\nI imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto. No, if he had\nbelieved me at all to share his feelings, he would not have been so wretched.\nCould he have thought himself encouraged, his looks and language at parting\nwould have been different.—Still, however, I must be on my guard. This is\nin the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is; but I do not\nknow that I expect it will; I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of\nman—I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy.—His\nfeelings are warm, but I can imagine them rather changeable.—Every\nconsideration of the subject, in short, makes me thankful that my happiness is\nnot more deeply involved.—I shall do very well again after a little\nwhile—and then, it will be a good thing over; for they say every body is\nin love once in their lives, and I shall have been let off easily.”',
			'When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it; and she\nread it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake\nher head over her own sensations, and think she had undervalued their strength.\nIt was a long, well-written letter, giving the particulars of his journey and\nof his feelings, expressing all the affection, gratitude, and respect which was\nnatural and honourable, and describing every thing exterior and local that\ncould be supposed attractive, with spirit and precision. No suspicious\nflourishes now of apology or concern; it was the language of real feeling\ntowards Mrs. Weston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast\nbetween the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just\nenough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much more might have\nbeen said but for the restraints of propriety.—The charm of her own name\nwas not wanting. Miss Woodhouse appeared more than once, and\nnever without a something of pleasing connexion, either a compliment to her\ntaste, or a remembrance of what she had said; and in the very last time of its\nmeeting her eye, unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry, she\nyet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest\ncompliment perhaps of all conveyed. Compressed into the very lowest vacant\ncorner were these words—“I had not a spare moment on Tuesday, as\nyou know, for Miss Woodhouse’s beautiful little friend. Pray make my\nexcuses and adieus to her.” This, Emma could not doubt, was all for\nherself. Harriet was remembered only from being her friend. His\ninformation and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had\nbeen anticipated; Mrs. Churchill was recovering, and he dared not yet, even in\nhis own imagination, fix a time for coming to Randalls again.',
			'Gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the material part,\nits sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up and returned to Mrs.\nWeston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, that she could still do\nwithout the writer, and that he must learn to do without her. Her intentions\nwere unchanged. Her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the\naddition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness. His\nrecollection of Harriet, and the words which clothed it, the “beautiful\nlittle friend,” suggested to her the idea of Harriet’s succeeding\nher in his affections. Was it impossible?—No.—Harriet undoubtedly\nwas greatly his inferior in understanding; but he had been very much struck\nwith the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all\nthe probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.—For\nHarriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.',
			'“I must not dwell upon it,” said she.—“I must not think\nof it. I know the danger of indulging such speculations. But stranger things\nhave happened; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now, it will\nbe the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship\nwhich I can already look forward to with pleasure.”',
			'It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet’s behalf, though it\nmight be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that quarter was at\nhand. As Frank Churchill’s arrival had succeeded Mr. Elton’s\nengagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latest interest had entirely\nborne down the first, so now upon Frank Churchill’s disappearance, Mr.\nElton’s concerns were assuming the most irresistible form.—His\nwedding-day was named. He would soon be among them again; Mr. Elton and his\nbride. There was hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe before\n“Mr. Elton and his bride” was in every body’s mouth, and\nFrank Churchill was forgotten. Emma grew sick at the sound. She had had three\nweeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton; and Harriet’s mind, she had been\nwilling to hope, had been lately gaining strength. With Mr. Weston’s ball\nin view at least, there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things;\nbut it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure\nas could stand against the actual approach—new carriage, bell-ringing,\nand all.',
			'Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and\nsoothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could give. Emma felt that she\ncould not do too much for her, that Harriet had a right to all her ingenuity\nand all her patience; but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without\nproducing any effect, for ever agreed to, without being able to make their\nopinions the same. Harriet listened submissively, and said “it was very\ntrue—it was just as Miss Woodhouse described—it was not worth while\nto think about them—and she would not think about them any longer”\nbut no change of subject could avail, and the next half-hour saw her as anxious\nand restless about the Eltons as before. At last Emma attacked her on another\nground.',
			'“Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr.\nElton’s marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make\nme. You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into.\nIt was all my doing, I know. I have not forgotten it, I assure\nyou.—Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you—and it will\nbe a painful reflection to me for ever. Do not imagine me in danger of\nforgetting it.”',
			'Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation.\nEmma continued,',
			'“I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less, talk\nless of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather, I would wish\nit to be done, for the sake of what is more important than my comfort, a habit\nof self-command in you, a consideration of what is your duty, an attention to\npropriety, an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others, to save your health\nand credit, and restore your tranquillity. These are the motives which I have\nbeen pressing on you. They are very important—and sorry I am that you\ncannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them. My being saved from pain is a\nvery secondary consideration. I want you to save yourself from greater pain.\nPerhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was\ndue—or rather what would be kind by me.”',
			'This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest. The idea of wanting\ngratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom she really loved\nextremely, made her wretched for a while, and when the violence of grief was\ncomforted away, still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and\nsupport her in it very tolerably.',
			'“You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life—Want\ngratitude to you!—Nobody is equal to you!—I care for nobody as I do\nfor you!—Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!”',
			'Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner\ncould do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so well, nor valued\nher affection so highly before.',
			'“There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,” said she\nafterwards to herself. “There is nothing to be compared to it. Warmth and\ntenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all the\nclearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure it will. It is\ntenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved—which\ngives Isabella all her popularity.—I have it not—but I know how to\nprize and respect it.—Harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the\nfelicity it gives. Dear Harriet!—I would not change you for the\nclearest-headed, longest-sighted, best-judging female breathing. Oh! the\ncoldness of a Jane Fairfax!—Harriet is worth a hundred such—And for\na wife—a sensible man’s wife—it is invaluable. I mention no\nnames; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!”',

		[
			'Mrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might be interrupted,\ncuriosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, and it must be left for\nthe visits in form which were then to be paid, to settle whether she were very\npretty indeed, or only rather pretty, or not pretty at all.',
			'Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to make her\nresolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and she made a point of\nHarriet’s going with her, that the worst of the business might be gone\nthrough as soon as possible.',
			'She could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room to which she\nhad with such vain artifice retreated three months ago, to lace up her boot,\nwithout recollecting. A thousand vexatious thoughts would recur.\nCompliments, charades, and horrible blunders; and it was not to be supposed\nthat poor Harriet should not be recollecting too; but she behaved very well,\nand was only rather pale and silent. The visit was of course short; and there\nwas so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma would\nnot allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady, and on no account to\ngive one, beyond the nothing-meaning terms of being “elegantly dressed,\nand very pleasing.”',
			'She did not really like her. She would not be in a hurry to find fault, but she\nsuspected that there was no elegance;—ease, but not elegance.— She\nwas almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride, there was too much\nease. Her person was rather good; her face not unpretty; but neither feature,\nnor air, nor voice, nor manner, were elegant. Emma thought at least it would\nturn out so.',
			'As for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear—but no, she would not permit\na hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners. It was an awkward\nceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and a man had need be all\ngrace to acquit himself well through it. The woman was better off; she might\nhave the assistance of fine clothes, and the privilege of bashfulness, but the\nman had only his own good sense to depend on; and when she considered how\npeculiarly unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with\nthe woman he had just married, the woman he had wanted to marry, and the woman\nwhom he had been expected to marry, she must allow him to have the right to\nlook as little wise, and to be as much affectedly, and as little really easy as\ncould be.',
			'“Well, Miss Woodhouse,” said Harriet, when they had quitted the\nhouse, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin; “Well, Miss\nWoodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?—Is not she\nvery charming?”',
			'There was a little hesitation in Emma’s answer.',
			'“Oh! yes—very—a very pleasing young woman.”',
			'“I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.”',
			'“Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.”',
			'“I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.”',
			'“Oh! no—there is nothing to surprize one at all.—A pretty\nfortune; and she came in his way.”',
			'“I dare say,” returned Harriet, sighing again, “I dare say\nshe was very much attached to him.”',
			'“Perhaps she might; but it is not every man’s fate to marry the\nwoman who loves him best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought this\nthe best offer she was likely to have.”',
			'“Yes,” said Harriet earnestly, “and well she might, nobody\ncould ever have a better. Well, I wish them happy with all my heart. And now,\nMiss Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again. He is just as\nsuperior as ever;—but being married, you know, it is quite a different\nthing. No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need not be afraid; I can sit and admire\nhim now without any great misery. To know that he has not thrown himself away,\nis such a comfort!—She does seem a charming young woman, just what he\ndeserves. Happy creature! He called her ‘Augusta.’ How\ndelightful!”',
			'When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind. She could then see more and\njudge better. From Harriet’s happening not to be at Hartfield, and her\nfather’s being present to engage Mr. Elton, she had a quarter of an hour\nof the lady’s conversation to herself, and could composedly attend to\nher; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain\nwoman, extremely well satisfied with herself, and thinking much of her own\nimportance; that she meant to shine and be very superior, but with manners\nwhich had been formed in a bad school, pert and familiar; that all her notions\nwere drawn from one set of people, and one style of living; that if not foolish\nshe was ignorant, and that her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good.',
			'Harriet would have been a better match. If not wise or refined herself, she\nwould have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins, it might be\nfairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best of her own set. The\nrich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride of the alliance, and his place\nand his carriages were the pride of him.',
			'The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, “My brother\nMr. Suckling’s seat;”—a comparison of Hartfield to Maple\nGrove. The grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the house\nwas modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably impressed by the\nsize of the room, the entrance, and all that she could see or imagine.\n“Very like Maple Grove indeed!—She was quite struck by the\nlikeness!—That room was the very shape and size of the morning-room at\nMaple Grove; her sister’s favourite room.”—Mr. Elton was\nappealed to.—“Was not it astonishingly like?—She could really\nalmost fancy herself at Maple Grove.”',
			'“And the staircase—You know, as I came in, I observed how very like\nthe staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. I really could\nnot help exclaiming! I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it is very delightful to me,\nto be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove. I have\nspent so many happy months there! (with a little sigh of sentiment). A charming\nplace, undoubtedly. Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty; but to me,\nit has been quite a home. Whenever you are transplanted, like me, Miss\nWoodhouse, you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing\nat all like what one has left behind. I always say this is quite one of the\nevils of matrimony.”',
			'Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient for Mrs.\nElton, who only wanted to be talking herself.',
			'“So extremely like Maple Grove! And it is not merely the house—the\ngrounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly like. The\nlaurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, and stand very much\nin the same way—just across the lawn; and I had a glimpse of a fine large\ntree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly in mind! My brother and\nsister will be enchanted with this place. People who have extensive grounds\nthemselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style.”',
			'Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment. She had a great idea that people who\nhad extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of\nany body else; but it was not worth while to attack an error so double-dyed,\nand therefore only said in reply,',
			'“When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think you\nhave overrated Hartfield. Surry is full of beauties.”',
			'“Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that. It is the garden of England, you\nknow. Surry is the garden of England.”',
			'“Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. Many counties,\nI believe, are called the garden of England, as well as Surry.”',
			'“No, I fancy not,” replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile.\n“I never heard any county but Surry called so.”',
			'Emma was silenced.',
			'“My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, or summer\nat farthest,” continued Mrs. Elton; “and that will be our time for\nexploring. While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, I dare say.\nThey will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holds four perfectly;\nand therefore, without saying any thing of our carriage, we should be\nable to explore the different beauties extremely well. They would hardly come\nin their chaise, I think, at that season of the year. Indeed, when the time\ndraws on, I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche-landau; it\nwill be so very much preferable. When people come into a beautiful country of\nthis sort, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much\nas possible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring. We explored to\nKing’s-Weston twice last summer, in that way, most delightfully, just\nafter their first having the barouche-landau. You have many parties of that\nkind here, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?”',
			'“No; not immediately here. We are rather out of distance of the very\nstriking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; and we are a\nvery quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay at home than engage\nin schemes of pleasure.”',
			'“Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. Nobody can\nbe more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb for it at Maple Grove.\nMany a time has Selina said, when she has been going to Bristol, ‘I\nreally cannot get this girl to move from the house. I absolutely must go in by\nmyself, though I hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau without a\ncompanion; but Augusta, I believe, with her own good-will, would never stir\nbeyond the park paling.’ Many a time has she said so; and yet I am no\nadvocate for entire seclusion. I think, on the contrary, when people shut\nthemselves up entirely from society, it is a very bad thing; and that it is\nmuch more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree, without living in\nit either too much or too little. I perfectly understand your situation,\nhowever, Miss Woodhouse—(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your\nfather’s state of health must be a great drawback. Why does not he try\nBath?—Indeed he should. Let me recommend Bath to you. I assure you I have\nno doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse good.”',
			'“My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving any\nbenefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown to you, does not\nconceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now.”',
			'“Ah! that’s a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, where\nthe waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief they give. In my Bath\nlife, I have seen such instances of it! And it is so cheerful a place, that it\ncould not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse’s spirits, which, I\nunderstand, are sometimes much depressed. And as to its recommendations to\nyou, I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell on them. The advantages\nof Bath to the young are pretty generally understood. It would be a charming\nintroduction for you, who have lived so secluded a life; and I could\nimmediately secure you some of the best society in the place. A line from me\nwould bring you a little host of acquaintance; and my particular friend, Mrs.\nPartridge, the lady I have always resided with when in Bath, would be most\nhappy to shew you any attentions, and would be the very person for you to go\ninto public with.”',
			'It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. The idea of her\nbeing indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an\nintroduction—of her going into public under the auspices of a\nfriend of Mrs. Elton’s—probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who,\nwith the help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!—The dignity of\nMiss Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!',
			'She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could have given,\nand only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; “but their going to Bath was quite\nout of the question; and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might\nsuit her better than her father.” And then, to prevent farther outrage\nand indignation, changed the subject directly.',
			'“I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton. Upon these occasions,\na lady’s character generally precedes her; and Highbury has long known\nthat you are a superior performer.”',
			'“Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superior\nperformer!—very far from it, I assure you. Consider from how partial a\nquarter your information came. I am doatingly fond of music—passionately\nfond;—and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of taste; but as to any\nthing else, upon my honour my performance is mediocre to the last\ndegree. You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play delightfully. I assure you it\nhas been the greatest satisfaction, comfort, and delight to me, to hear what a\nmusical society I am got into. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a\nnecessary of life to me; and having always been used to a very musical society,\nboth at Maple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. I\nhonestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home, and\nexpressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable; and the\ninferiority of the house too—knowing what I had been accustomed\nto—of course he was not wholly without apprehension. When he was speaking\nof it in that way, I honestly said that the world I could give\nup—parties, balls, plays—for I had no fear of retirement. Blessed\nwith so many resources within myself, the world was not necessary to me.\nI could do very well without it. To those who had no resources it was a\ndifferent thing; but my resources made me quite independent. And as to\nsmaller-sized rooms than I had been used to, I really could not give it a\nthought. I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description.\nCertainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove; but I did\nassure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness, nor were\nspacious apartments. ‘But,’ said I, ‘to be quite honest, I do\nnot think I can live without something of a musical society. I condition for\nnothing else; but without music, life would be a blank to me.’”',
			'“We cannot suppose,” said Emma, smiling, “that Mr. Elton\nwould hesitate to assure you of there being a very musical society in\nHighbury; and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than\nmay be pardoned, in consideration of the motive.”',
			'“No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head. I am delighted to find\nmyself in such a circle. I hope we shall have many sweet little concerts\ntogether. I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish a musical club, and\nhave regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours. Will not it be a good\nplan? If we exert ourselves, I think we shall not be long in want of\nallies. Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for me,\nas an inducement to keep me in practice; for married women, you\nknow—there is a sad story against them, in general. They are but too apt\nto give up music.”',
			'“But you, who are so extremely fond of it—there can be no danger,\nsurely?”',
			'“I should hope not; but really when I look around among my acquaintance,\nI tremble. Selina has entirely given up music—never touches the\ninstrument—though she played sweetly. And the same may be said of Mrs.\nJeffereys—Clara Partridge, that was—and of the two Milmans, now\nMrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate. Upon my word\nit is enough to put one in a fright. I used to be quite angry with Selina; but\nreally I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call\nher attention. I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my\nhousekeeper.”',
			'“But every thing of that kind,” said Emma, “will soon be in\nso regular a train—”',
			'“Well,” said Mrs. Elton, laughing, “we shall see.”',
			'Emma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music, had nothing more to\nsay; and, after a moment’s pause, Mrs. Elton chose another subject.',
			'“We have been calling at Randalls,” said she, “and found them\nboth at home; and very pleasant people they seem to be. I like them extremely.\nMr. Weston seems an excellent creature—quite a first-rate favourite with\nme already, I assure you. And she appears so truly good—there is\nsomething so motherly and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one\ndirectly. She was your governess, I think?”',
			'Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton hardly waited for\nthe affirmative before she went on.',
			'“Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her so very\nlady-like! But she is really quite the gentlewoman.”',
			'“Mrs. Weston’s manners,” said Emma, “were always\nparticularly good. Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them\nthe safest model for any young woman.”',
			'“And who do you think came in while we were there?”',
			'Emma was quite at a loss. The tone implied some old acquaintance—and how\ncould she possibly guess?',
			'“Knightley!” continued Mrs. Elton; “Knightley\nhimself!—Was not it lucky?—for, not being within when he called the\nother day, I had never seen him before; and of course, as so particular a\nfriend of Mr. E.’s, I had a great curiosity. ‘My friend\nKnightley’ had been so often mentioned, that I was really impatient to\nsee him; and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be\nashamed of his friend. Knightley is quite the gentleman. I like him very much.\nDecidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man.”',
			'Happily, it was now time to be gone. They were off; and Emma could breathe.',
			'“Insufferable woman!” was her immediate exclamation. “Worse\nthan I had supposed. Absolutely insufferable! Knightley!—I could not have\nbelieved it. Knightley!—never seen him in her life before, and call him\nKnightley!—and discover that he is a gentleman! A little upstart, vulgar\nbeing, with her Mr. E., and her caro sposo, and her resources,\nand all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery. Actually to discover\nthat Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! I doubt whether he will return the\ncompliment, and discover her to be a lady. I could not have believed it! And to\npropose that she and I should unite to form a musical club! One would fancy we\nwere bosom friends! And Mrs. Weston!—Astonished that the person who had\nbrought me up should be a gentlewoman! Worse and worse. I never met with her\nequal. Much beyond my hopes. Harriet is disgraced by any comparison. Oh! what\nwould Frank Churchill say to her, if he were here? How angry and how diverted\nhe would be! Ah! there I am—thinking of him directly. Always the first\nperson to be thought of! How I catch myself out! Frank Churchill comes as\nregularly into my mind!”—',
			'All this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time her father had\narranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons’ departure, and was\nready to speak, she was very tolerably capable of attending.',
			'“Well, my dear,” he deliberately began, “considering we never\nsaw her before, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say she\nwas very much pleased with you. She speaks a little too quick. A little\nquickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. But I believe I am\nnice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks like you and poor Miss\nTaylor. However, she seems a very obliging, pretty-behaved young lady, and no\ndoubt will make him a very good wife. Though I think he had better not have\nmarried. I made the best excuses I could for not having been able to wait on\nhim and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion; I said that I hoped I should\nin the course of the summer. But I ought to have gone before. Not to wait upon\na bride is very remiss. Ah! it shews what a sad invalid I am! But I do not like\nthe corner into Vicarage Lane.”',
			'“I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir. Mr. Elton knows\nyou.”',
			'“Yes: but a young lady—a bride—I ought to have paid my\nrespects to her if possible. It was being very deficient.”',
			'“But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore why\nshould you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride? It ought to be\nno recommendation to you. It is encouraging people to marry if you make\nso much of them.”',
			'“No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would always\nwish to pay every proper attention to a lady—and a bride, especially, is\nnever to be neglected. More is avowedly due to her. A bride, you know,\nmy dear, is always the first in company, let the others be who they may.”',
			'“Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know what\nis. And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such\nvanity-baits for poor young ladies.”',
			'“My dear, you do not understand me. This is a matter of mere common\npoliteness and good-breeding, and has nothing to do with any encouragement to\npeople to marry.”',
			'Emma had done. Her father was growing nervous, and could not understand\nher. Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton’s offences, and long, very\nlong, did they occupy her.',
		],
		[
			'Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill opinion\nof Mrs. Elton. Her observation had been pretty correct. Such as Mrs. Elton\nappeared to her on this second interview, such she appeared whenever they met\nagain,—self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant, and ill-bred. She\nhad a little beauty and a little accomplishment, but so little judgment that\nshe thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world, to enliven and\nimprove a country neighbourhood; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a\nplace in society as Mrs. Elton’s consequence only could surpass.',
			'There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently from his\nwife. He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud. He had the air of\ncongratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury, as not even\nMiss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater part of her new acquaintance,\ndisposed to commend, or not in the habit of judging, following the lead of Miss\nBates’s good-will, or taking it for granted that the bride must be as\nclever and as agreeable as she professed herself, were very well satisfied; so\nthat Mrs. Elton’s praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to\ndo, unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse, who readily continued her first contribution\nand talked with a good grace of her being “very pleasant and very\nelegantly dressed.”',
			'In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first. Her\nfeelings altered towards Emma.—Offended, probably, by the little\nencouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with, she drew back in her\nturn and gradually became much more cold and distant; and though the effect was\nagreeable, the ill-will which produced it was necessarily increasing\nEmma’s dislike. Her manners, too—and Mr. Elton’s, were\nunpleasant towards Harriet. They were sneering and negligent. Emma hoped it\nmust rapidly work Harriet’s cure; but the sensations which could prompt\nsuch behaviour sunk them both very much.—It was not to be doubted that\npoor Harriet’s attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve, and\nher own share in the story, under a colouring the least favourable to her and\nthe most soothing to him, had in all likelihood been given also. She was, of\ncourse, the object of their joint dislike.—When they had nothing else to\nsay, it must be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity\nwhich they dared not shew in open disrespect to her, found a broader vent in\ncontemptuous treatment of Harriet.',
			'Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first. Not merely\nwhen a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the\nother, but from the very first; and she was not satisfied with expressing a\nnatural and reasonable admiration—but without solicitation, or plea, or\nprivilege, she must be wanting to assist and befriend her.—Before Emma\nhad forfeited her confidence, and about the third time of their meeting, she\nheard all Mrs. Elton’s knight-errantry on the subject.—',
			'“Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.—I quite rave\nabout Jane Fairfax.—A sweet, interesting creature. So mild and\nladylike—and with such talents!—I assure you I think she has very\nextraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well. I\nknow enough of music to speak decidedly on that point. Oh! she is absolutely\ncharming! You will laugh at my warmth—but, upon my word, I talk of\nnothing but Jane Fairfax.—And her situation is so calculated to affect\none!—Miss Woodhouse, we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do\nsomething for her. We must bring her forward. Such talent as hers must not be\nsuffered to remain unknown.—I dare say you have heard those charming\nlines of the poet,',
			'‘Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,\n    ‘And waste its fragrance on the desert air.’',
			'We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax.”',
			'“I cannot think there is any danger of it,” was Emma’s calm\nanswer—“and when you are better acquainted with Miss\nFairfax’s situation and understand what her home has been, with Colonel\nand Mrs. Campbell, I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be\nunknown.”',
			'“Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement, such\nobscurity, so thrown away.—Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with\nthe Campbells are so palpably at an end! And I think she feels it. I am sure\nshe does. She is very timid and silent. One can see that she feels the want of\nencouragement. I like her the better for it. I must confess it is a\nrecommendation to me. I am a great advocate for timidity—and I am sure\none does not often meet with it.—But in those who are at all inferior, it\nis extremely prepossessing. Oh! I assure you, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful\ncharacter, and interests me more than I can express.”',
			'“You appear to feel a great deal—but I am not aware how you or any\nof Miss Fairfax’s acquaintance here, any of those who have known her\nlonger than yourself, can shew her any other attention than”—',
			'“My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare to\nact. You and I need not be afraid. If we set the example, many will\nfollow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations. We\nhave carriages to fetch and convey her home, and we live in a style\nwhich could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, at any time, the least\ninconvenient.—I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us\nup such a dinner, as could make me regret having asked more than Jane\nFairfax to partake of it. I have no idea of that sort of thing. It is not\nlikely that I should, considering what I have been used to. My greatest\ndanger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the other way, in doing too\nmuch, and being too careless of expense. Maple Grove will probably be my model\nmore than it ought to be—for we do not at all affect to equal my brother,\nMr. Suckling, in income.—However, my resolution is taken as to noticing\nJane Fairfax.—I shall certainly have her very often at my house, shall\nintroduce her wherever I can, shall have musical parties to draw out her\ntalents, and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation. My\nacquaintance is so very extensive, that I have little doubt of hearing of\nsomething to suit her shortly.—I shall introduce her, of course, very\nparticularly to my brother and sister when they come to us. I am sure they will\nlike her extremely; and when she gets a little acquainted with them, her fears\nwill completely wear off, for there really is nothing in the manners of either\nbut what is highly conciliating.—I shall have her very often indeed while\nthey are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the\nbarouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.”',
			'“Poor Jane Fairfax!”—thought Emma.—“You have not\ndeserved this. You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a\npunishment beyond what you can have merited!—The kindness and protection\nof Mrs. Elton!—‘Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.’ Heavens! Let\nme not suppose that she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!—But upon\nmy honour, there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman’s\ntongue!”',
			'Emma had not to listen to such paradings again—to any so exclusively\naddressed to herself—so disgustingly decorated with a “dear Miss\nWoodhouse.” The change on Mrs. Elton’s side soon afterwards\nappeared, and she was left in peace—neither forced to be the very\nparticular friend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton’s guidance, the\nvery active patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a\ngeneral way, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done.',
			'She looked on with some amusement.—Miss Bates’s gratitude for Mrs.\nElton’s attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity\nand warmth. She was quite one of her worthies—the most amiable, affable,\ndelightful woman—just as accomplished and condescending as Mrs. Elton\nmeant to be considered. Emma’s only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should\naccept those attentions and tolerate Mrs. Elton as she seemed to do. She heard\nof her walking with the Eltons, sitting with the Eltons, spending a day with\nthe Eltons! This was astonishing!—She could not have believed it possible\nthat the taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and\nfriendship as the Vicarage had to offer.',
			'“She is a riddle, quite a riddle!” said she.—“To chuse\nto remain here month after month, under privations of every sort! And now to\nchuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton’s notice and the penury of her\nconversation, rather than return to the superior companions who have always\nloved her with such real, generous affection.”',
			'Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells were gone\nto Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells had promised their daughter\nto stay at least till Midsummer, and fresh invitations had arrived for her to\njoin them there. According to Miss Bates—it all came from her—Mrs.\nDixon had written most pressingly. Would Jane but go, means were to be found,\nservants sent, friends contrived—no travelling difficulty allowed to\nexist; but still she had declined it!',
			'“She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing this\ninvitation,” was Emma’s conclusion. “She must be under some\nsort of penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself. There is great\nfear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.—She is not to be\nwith the Dixons. The decree is issued by somebody. But why must she\nconsent to be with the Eltons?—Here is quite a separate puzzle.”',
			'Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before the few\nwho knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston ventured this apology for Jane.',
			'“We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage, my\ndear Emma—but it is better than being always at home. Her aunt is a good\ncreature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. We must consider\nwhat Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her taste for what she goes\nto.”',
			'“You are right, Mrs. Weston,” said Mr. Knightley warmly,\n“Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of\nMrs. Elton. Could she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have\nchosen her. But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives attentions from\nMrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her.”',
			'Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance; and she was\nherself struck by his warmth. With a faint blush, she presently replied,',
			'“Such attentions as Mrs. Elton’s, I should have imagined, would\nrather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton’s invitations I\nshould have imagined any thing but inviting.”',
			'“I should not wonder,” said Mrs. Weston, “if Miss Fairfax\nwere to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt’s\neagerness in accepting Mrs. Elton’s civilities for her. Poor Miss Bates\nmay very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater\nappearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated, in spite of\nthe very natural wish of a little change.”',
			'Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few minutes\nsilence, he said,',
			'“Another thing must be taken into consideration too—Mrs. Elton does\nnot talk to Miss Fairfax as she speaks of her. We all know the\ndifference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest spoken amongst\nus; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our\npersonal intercourse with each other—a something more early implanted. We\ncannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of\nthe hour before. We feel things differently. And besides the operation of this,\nas a general principle, you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by\nher superiority both of mind and manner; and that, face to face, Mrs. Elton\ntreats her with all the respect which she has a claim to. Such a woman as Jane\nFairfax probably never fell in Mrs. Elton’s way before—and no\ndegree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness\nin action, if not in consciousness.”',
			'“I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,” said Emma. Little\nHenry was in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her\nirresolute what else to say.',
			'“Yes,” he replied, “any body may know how highly I think of\nher.”',
			'“And yet,” said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look, but\nsoon stopping—it was better, however, to know the worst at once—she\nhurried on—“And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself how\nhighly it is. The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day\nor other.”',
			'Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather\ngaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together, or some other cause,\nbrought the colour into his face, as he answered,',
			'“Oh! are you there?—But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. Cole gave\nme a hint of it six weeks ago.”',
			'He stopped.—Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did not\nherself know what to think. In a moment he went on—',
			'“That will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss Fairfax, I dare say,\nwould not have me if I were to ask her—and I am very sure I shall never\nask her.”',
			'Emma returned her friend’s pressure with interest; and was pleased enough\nto exclaim,',
			'“You are not vain, Mr. Knightley. I will say that for you.”',
			'He seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful—and in a manner which\nshewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,',
			'“So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?”',
			'“No indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much for match-making, for\nme to presume to take such a liberty with you. What I said just now, meant\nnothing. One says those sort of things, of course, without any idea of a\nserious meaning. Oh! no, upon my word I have not the smallest wish for your\nmarrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. You would not come in and sit with us\nin this comfortable way, if you were married.”',
			'Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again. The result of his reverie was, “No,\nEmma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by\nsurprize.—I never had a thought of her in that way, I assure you.”\nAnd soon afterwards, “Jane Fairfax is a very charming young\nwoman—but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect. She has a fault. She has not\nthe open temper which a man would wish for in a wife.”',
			'Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault. “Well,”\nsaid she, “and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?”',
			'“Yes, very soon. He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken; he\nasked my pardon and said no more. Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier\nthan his neighbours.”',
			'“In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser and\nwittier than all the world! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles—what she\ncalls them! How can she find any appellation for them, deep enough in familiar\nvulgarity? She calls you, Knightley—what can she do for Mr. Cole? And so\nI am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents\nto be with her. Mrs. Weston, your argument weighs most with me. I can much more\nreadily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates, than I can\nbelieve in the triumph of Miss Fairfax’s mind over Mrs. Elton. I have no\nfaith in Mrs. Elton’s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought,\nword, or deed; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule\nof good-breeding. I cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting\nher visitor with praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will\nnot be continually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring her\na permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring\nparties which are to take place in the barouche-landau.”',
			'“Jane Fairfax has feeling,” said Mr. Knightley—“I do\nnot accuse her of want of feeling. Her sensibilities, I suspect, are\nstrong—and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance, patience,\nself-control; but it wants openness. She is reserved, more reserved, I think,\nthan she used to be—And I love an open temper. No—till Cole alluded\nto my supposed attachment, it had never entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfax and\nconversed with her, with admiration and pleasure always—but with no\nthought beyond.”',
			'“Well, Mrs. Weston,” said Emma triumphantly when he left them,\n“what do you say now to Mr. Knightley’s marrying Jane\nFairfax?”',
			'“Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied by the\nidea of not being in love with her, that I should not wonder if it were\nto end in his being so at last. Do not beat me.”',

		[
			'Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton, was disposed\nto pay him attention on his marriage. Dinner-parties and evening-parties were\nmade for him and his lady; and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon\nthe pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day.',
			'“I see how it is,” said she. “I see what a life I am to lead\namong you. Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. We really seem quite\nthe fashion. If this is living in the country, it is nothing very formidable.\nFrom Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have not a disengaged\nday!—A woman with fewer resources than I have, need not have been at a\nloss.”',
			'No invitation came amiss to her. Her Bath habits made evening-parties perfectly\nnatural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste for dinners. She was a\nlittle shocked at the want of two drawing rooms, at the poor attempt at\nrout-cakes, and there being no ice in the Highbury card-parties. Mrs. Bates,\nMrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddard and others, were a good deal behind-hand in knowledge\nof the world, but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be\narranged. In the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one\nvery superior party—in which her card-tables should be set out with their\nseparate candles and unbroken packs in the true style—and more waiters\nengaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish, to carry\nround the refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.',
			'Emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner at Hartfield\nfor the Eltons. They must not do less than others, or she should be exposed to\nodious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitiful resentment. A dinner there\nmust be. After Emma had talked about it for ten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no\nunwillingness, and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom\nof the table himself, with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should\ndo it for him.',
			'The persons to be invited, required little thought. Besides the Eltons, it must\nbe the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of course—and it was\nhardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must be asked to make the\neighth:—but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction, and on\nmany accounts Emma was particularly pleased by Harriet’s begging to be\nallowed to decline it. “She would rather not be in his company more than\nshe could help. She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy\nwife together, without feeling uncomfortable. If Miss Woodhouse would not be\ndispleased, she would rather stay at home.” It was precisely what Emma\nwould have wished, had she deemed it possible enough for wishing. She was\ndelighted with the fortitude of her little friend—for fortitude she knew\nit was in her to give up being in company and stay at home; and she could now\ninvite the very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth, Jane\nFairfax.— Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley,\nshe was more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often\nbeen.—Mr. Knightley’s words dwelt with her. He had said that Jane\nFairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her.',
			'“This is very true,” said she, “at least as far as relates to\nme, which was all that was meant—and it is very shameful.—Of the\nsame age—and always knowing her—I ought to have been more her\nfriend.—She will never like me now. I have neglected her too long. But I\nwill shew her greater attention than I have done.”',
			'Every invitation was successful. They were all disengaged and all\nhappy.—The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet\nover. A circumstance rather unlucky occurred. The two eldest little Knightleys\nwere engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the\nspring, and their papa now proposed bringing them, and staying one whole day at\nHartfield—which one day would be the very day of this party.—His\nprofessional engagements did not allow of his being put off, but both father\nand daughter were disturbed by its happening so. Mr. Woodhouse considered eight\npersons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear—and\nhere would be a ninth—and Emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very\nmuch out of humour at not being able to come even to Hartfield for forty-eight\nhours without falling in with a dinner-party.',
			'She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself, by representing\nthat though he certainly would make them nine, yet he always said so little,\nthat the increase of noise would be very immaterial. She thought it in reality\na sad exchange for herself, to have him with his grave looks and reluctant\nconversation opposed to her instead of his brother.',
			'The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma. John Knightley\ncame; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on\nthe very day. He might be able to join them in the evening, but certainly not\nto dinner. Mr. Woodhouse was quite at ease; and the seeing him so, with the\narrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on\nhearing his fate, removed the chief of even Emma’s vexation.',
			'The day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John Knightley\nseemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable. Instead of\ndrawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner, he was\ntalking to Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton, as elegant as lace and pearls could make\nher, he looked at in silence—wanting only to observe enough for\nIsabella’s information—but Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and\na quiet girl, and he could talk to her. He had met her before breakfast as he\nwas returning from a walk with his little boys, when it had been just beginning\nto rain. It was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject, and he said,',
			'“I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I am sure\nyou must have been wet.—We scarcely got home in time. I hope you turned\ndirectly.”',
			'“I went only to the post-office,” said she, “and reached home\nbefore the rain was much. It is my daily errand. I always fetch the letters\nwhen I am here. It saves trouble, and is a something to get me out. A walk\nbefore breakfast does me good.”',
			'“Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine.”',
			'“No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.”',
			'Mr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,',
			'“That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six yards\nfrom your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and Henry and John\nhad seen more drops than they could count long before. The post-office has a\ngreat charm at one period of our lives. When you have lived to my age, you will\nbegin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for.”',
			'There was a little blush, and then this answer,',
			'“I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of every\ndearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing older\nshould make me indifferent about letters.”',
			'“Indifferent! Oh! no—I never conceived you could become\nindifferent. Letters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very\npositive curse.”',
			'“You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of\nfriendship.”',
			'“I have often thought them the worst of the two,” replied he\ncoolly. “Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever\ndoes.”',
			'“Ah! you are not serious now. I know Mr. John Knightley too well—I\nam very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body. I can\neasily believe that letters are very little to you, much less than to me, but\nit is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference, it\nis not age, but situation. You have every body dearest to you always at hand,\nI, probably, never shall again; and therefore till I have outlived all my\naffections, a post-office, I think, must always have power to draw me out, in\nworse weather than to-day.”',
			'“When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of\nyears,” said John Knightley, “I meant to imply the change of\nsituation which time usually brings. I consider one as including the other.\nTime will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the\ndaily circle—but that is not the change I had in view for you. As an old\nfriend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten years hence you may\nhave as many concentrated objects as I have.”',
			'It was kindly said, and very far from giving offence. A pleasant “thank\nyou” seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip, a tear\nin the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh. Her attention was now\nclaimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being, according to his custom on such occasions,\nmaking the circle of his guests, and paying his particular compliments to the\nladies, was ending with her—and with all his mildest urbanity, said,',
			'“I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this morning in\nthe rain. Young ladies should take care of themselves.—Young ladies are\ndelicate plants. They should take care of their health and their complexion. My\ndear, did you change your stockings?”',
			'“Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind\nsolicitude about me.”',
			'“My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared\nfor.—I hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well. They are some of my\nvery old friends. I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour. You do\nus a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure. My daughter and I are both highly\nsensible of your goodness, and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at\nHartfield.”',
			'The kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done\nhis duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.',
			'By this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton, and her\nremonstrances now opened upon Jane.',
			'“My dear Jane, what is this I hear?—Going to the post-office in the\nrain!—This must not be, I assure you.—You sad girl, how could you\ndo such a thing?—It is a sign I was not there to take care of you.”',
			'Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.',
			'“Oh! do not tell me. You really are a very sad girl, and do not\nknow how to take care of yourself.—To the post-office indeed! Mrs.\nWeston, did you ever hear the like? You and I must positively exert our\nauthority.”',
			'“My advice,” said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, “I\ncertainly do feel tempted to give. Miss Fairfax, you must not run such\nrisks.—Liable as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to be\nparticularly careful, especially at this time of year. The spring I always\nthink requires more than common care. Better wait an hour or two, or even half\na day for your letters, than run the risk of bringing on your cough again. Now\ndo not you feel that you had? Yes, I am sure you are much too reasonable. You\nlook as if you would not do such a thing again.”',
			'“Oh! she shall not do such a thing again,” eagerly\nrejoined Mrs. Elton. “We will not allow her to do such a thing\nagain:”—and nodding significantly—“there must be some\narrangement made, there must indeed. I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who\nfetches our letters every morning (one of our men, I forget his name) shall\ninquire for yours too and bring them to you. That will obviate all difficulties\nyou know; and from us I really think, my dear Jane, you can have no\nscruple to accept such an accommodation.”',
			'“You are extremely kind,” said Jane; “but I cannot give up my\nearly walk. I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I must walk\nsomewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, I have scarcely\never had a bad morning before.”',
			'“My dear Jane, say no more about it. The thing is determined, that is\n(laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without\nthe concurrence of my lord and master. You know, Mrs. Weston, you and I must be\ncautious how we express ourselves. But I do flatter myself, my dear Jane, that\nmy influence is not entirely worn out. If I meet with no insuperable\ndifficulties therefore, consider that point as settled.”',
			'“Excuse me,” said Jane earnestly, “I cannot by any means\nconsent to such an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant. If\nthe errand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is when I\nam not here, by my grandmama’s.”',
			'“Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!—And it is a kindness\nto employ our men.”',
			'Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead of answering,\nshe began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.',
			'“The post-office is a wonderful establishment!” said\nshe.—“The regularity and despatch of it! If one thinks of all that\nit has to do, and all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!”',
			'“It is certainly very well regulated.”',
			'“So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears! So seldom that a\nletter, among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom, is\neven carried wrong—and not one in a million, I suppose, actually lost!\nAnd when one considers the variety of hands, and of bad hands too, that are to\nbe deciphered, it increases the wonder.”',
			'“The clerks grow expert from habit.—They must begin with some\nquickness of sight and hand, and exercise improves them. If you want any\nfarther explanation,” continued he, smiling, “they are paid for it.\nThat is the key to a great deal of capacity. The public pays and must be served\nwell.”',
			'The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual observations\nmade.',
			'“I have heard it asserted,” said John Knightley, “that the\nsame sort of handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same master\nteaches, it is natural enough. But for that reason, I should imagine the\nlikeness must be chiefly confined to the females, for boys have very little\nteaching after an early age, and scramble into any hand they can get. Isabella\nand Emma, I think, do write very much alike. I have not always known their\nwriting apart.”',
			'“Yes,” said his brother hesitatingly, “there is a likeness. I\nknow what you mean—but Emma’s hand is the strongest.”',
			'“Isabella and Emma both write beautifully,” said Mr. Woodhouse;\n“and always did. And so does poor Mrs. Weston”—with half a\nsigh and half a smile at her.',
			'“I never saw any gentleman’s handwriting”—Emma began,\nlooking also at Mrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was\nattending to some one else—and the pause gave her time to reflect,\n“Now, how am I going to introduce him?—Am I unequal to speaking his\nname at once before all these people? Is it necessary for me to use any\nroundabout phrase?—Your Yorkshire friend—your correspondent in\nYorkshire;—that would be the way, I suppose, if I were very\nbad.—No, I can pronounce his name without the smallest distress. I\ncertainly get better and better.—Now for it.”',
			'Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again—“Mr. Frank\nChurchill writes one of the best gentleman’s hands I ever saw.”',
			'“I do not admire it,” said Mr. Knightley. “It is too\nsmall—wants strength. It is like a woman’s writing.”',
			'This was not submitted to by either lady. They vindicated him against the base\naspersion. “No, it by no means wanted strength—it was not a large\nhand, but very clear and certainly strong. Had not Mrs. Weston any letter about\nher to produce?” No, she had heard from him very lately, but having\nanswered the letter, had put it away.',
			'“If we were in the other room,” said Emma, “if I had my\nwriting-desk, I am sure I could produce a specimen. I have a note of\nhis.—Do not you remember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for you one\nday?”',
			'“He chose to say he was employed”—',
			'“Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner to convince\nMr. Knightley.”',
			'“Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill,” said Mr.\nKnightley dryly, “writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse, he will, of\ncourse, put forth his best.”',
			'Dinner was on table.—Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to, was\nready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed\nto hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying—',
			'“Must I go first? I really am ashamed of always leading the way.”',
			'Jane’s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma.\nShe had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet\nwalk of this morning had produced any. She suspected that it had; that\nit would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of\nhearing from some one very dear, and that it had not been in vain. She thought\nthere was an air of greater happiness than usual—a glow both of\ncomplexion and spirits.',
			'She could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition and the expense of\nthe Irish mails;—it was at her tongue’s end—but she\nabstained. She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt Jane\nFairfax’s feelings; and they followed the other ladies out of the room,\narm in arm, with an appearance of good-will highly becoming to the beauty and\ngrace of each.',
		],
		[
			'When the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found it hardly\npossible to prevent their making two distinct parties;—with so much\nperseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton engross Jane Fairfax\nand slight herself. She and Mrs. Weston were obliged to be almost always either\ntalking together or silent together. Mrs. Elton left them no choice. If Jane\nrepressed her for a little time, she soon began again; and though much that\npassed between them was in a half-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton’s\nside, there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects: The\npost-office—catching cold—fetching letters—and friendship,\nwere long under discussion; and to them succeeded one, which must be at least\nequally unpleasant to Jane—inquiries whether she had yet heard of any\nsituation likely to suit her, and professions of Mrs. Elton’s meditated\nactivity.',
			'“Here is April come!” said she, “I get quite anxious about\nyou. June will soon be here.”',
			'“But I have never fixed on June or any other month—merely looked\nforward to the summer in general.”',
			'“But have you really heard of nothing?”',
			'“I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet.”',
			'“Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware of the\ndifficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing.”',
			'“I not aware!” said Jane, shaking her head; “dear Mrs. Elton,\nwho can have thought of it as I have done?”',
			'“But you have not seen so much of the world as I have. You do not know\nhow many candidates there always are for the first situations. I saw a\nvast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove. A cousin of Mr.\nSuckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity of applications; every body was\nanxious to be in her family, for she moves in the first circle. Wax-candles in\nthe schoolroom! You may imagine how desirable! Of all houses in the kingdom\nMrs. Bragge’s is the one I would most wish to see you in.”',
			'“Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,”\nsaid Jane. “I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will want\nit;—afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself. But I would\nnot wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present.”',
			'“Trouble! aye, I know your scruples. You are afraid of giving me trouble;\nbut I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly be more interested\nabout you than I am. I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in a day or two, and shall\ngive her a strict charge to be on the look-out for any thing eligible.”',
			'“Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her;\ntill the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any body trouble.”',
			'“But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, and June,\nor say even July, is very near, with such business to accomplish before us.\nYour inexperience really amuses me! A situation such as you deserve, and your\nfriends would require for you, is no everyday occurrence, is not obtained at a\nmoment’s notice; indeed, indeed, we must begin inquiring directly.”',
			'“Excuse me, ma’am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no\ninquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. When I am\nquite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being long\nunemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry would soon produce\nsomething—Offices for the sale—not quite of human flesh—but\nof human intellect.”',
			'“Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at the\nslave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the\nabolition.”',
			'“I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,” replied\nJane; “governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely\ndifferent certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to the\ngreater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies. But I only mean to\nsay that there are advertising offices, and that by applying to them I should\nhave no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do.”',
			'“Something that would do!” repeated Mrs. Elton. “Aye,\nthat may suit your humble ideas of yourself;—I know what a modest\ncreature you are; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up\nwith any thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation, in a family\nnot moving in a certain circle, or able to command the elegancies of\nlife.”',
			'“You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent; it\nwould be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications, I think, would\nonly be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison. A gentleman’s\nfamily is all that I should condition for.”',
			'“I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I shall be\na little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side;\nwith your superior talents, you have a right to move in the first circle. Your\nmusical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms, have as many\nrooms as you like, and mix in the family as much as you chose;—that\nis—I do not know—if you knew the harp, you might do all that, I am\nvery sure; but you sing as well as play;—yes, I really believe you might,\neven without the harp, stipulate for what you chose;—and you must and\nshall be delightfully, honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells\nor I have any rest.”',
			'“You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of such a\nsituation together,” said Jane, “they are pretty sure to be equal;\nhowever, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present\nfor me. I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mrs. Elton, I am obliged to any body\nwho feels for me, but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the\nsummer. For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am, and as I\nam.”',
			'“And I am quite serious too, I assure you,” replied Mrs. Elton\ngaily, “in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends\nto watch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us.”',
			'In this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr.\nWoodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change of object, and Emma\nheard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,',
			'“Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!—Only think of\nhis gallantry in coming away before the other men!—what a dear creature\nhe is;—I assure you I like him excessively. I admire all that quaint,\nold-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease; modern\nease often disgusts me. But this good old Mr. Woodhouse, I wish you had heard\nhis gallant speeches to me at dinner. Oh! I assure you I began to think my caro\nsposo would be absolutely jealous. I fancy I am rather a favourite; he took\nnotice of my gown. How do you like it?—Selina’s\nchoice—handsome, I think, but I do not know whether it is not\nover-trimmed; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being\nover-trimmed—quite a horror of finery. I must put on a few ornaments now,\nbecause it is expected of me. A bride, you know, must appear like a bride, but\nmy natural taste is all for simplicity; a simple style of dress is so\ninfinitely preferable to finery. But I am quite in the minority, I believe; few\npeople seem to value simplicity of dress,—show and finery are every\nthing. I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and\nsilver poplin. Do you think it will look well?”',
			'The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when Mr. Weston\nmade his appearance among them. He had returned to a late dinner, and walked to\nHartfield as soon as it was over. He had been too much expected by the best\njudges, for surprize—but there was great joy. Mr. Woodhouse was almost as\nglad to see him now, as he would have been sorry to see him before. John\nKnightley only was in mute astonishment.—That a man who might have spent\nhis evening quietly at home after a day of business in London, should set off\nagain, and walk half a mile to another man’s house, for the sake of being\nin mixed company till bed-time, of finishing his day in the efforts of civility\nand the noise of numbers, was a circumstance to strike him deeply. A man who\nhad been in motion since eight o’clock in the morning, and might now have\nbeen still, who had been long talking, and might have been silent, who had been\nin more than one crowd, and might have been alone!—Such a man, to quit\nthe tranquillity and independence of his own fireside, and on the evening of a\ncold sleety April day rush out again into the world!—Could he by a touch\nof his finger have instantly taken back his wife, there would have been a\nmotive; but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party.\nJohn Knightley looked at him with amazement, then shrugged his shoulders, and\nsaid, “I could not have believed it even of him.”',
			'Mr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was\nexciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all the right of being\nprincipal talker, which a day spent anywhere from home confers, was making\nhimself agreeable among the rest; and having satisfied the inquiries of his\nwife as to his dinner, convincing her that none of all her careful directions\nto the servants had been forgotten, and spread abroad what public news he had\nheard, was proceeding to a family communication, which, though principally\naddressed to Mrs. Weston, he had not the smallest doubt of being highly\ninteresting to every body in the room. He gave her a letter, it was from Frank,\nand to herself; he had met with it in his way, and had taken the liberty of\nopening it.',
			'“Read it, read it,” said he, “it will give you pleasure; only\na few lines—will not take you long; read it to Emma.”',
			'The two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling and talking to them\nthe whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but very audible to every body.',
			'“Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think. Well, what do you say\nto it?—I always told you he would be here again soon, did not\nI?—Anne, my dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would not believe\nme?—In town next week, you see—at the latest, I dare say; for\nshe is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done;\nmost likely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday. As to her illness, all\nnothing of course. But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us again,\nso near as town. They will stay a good while when they do come, and he will be\nhalf his time with us. This is precisely what I wanted. Well, pretty good news,\nis not it? Have you finished it? Has Emma read it all? Put it up, put it up; we\nwill have a good talk about it some other time, but it will not do now. I shall\nonly just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way.”',
			'Mrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion. Her looks and words\nhad nothing to restrain them. She was happy, she knew she was happy, and knew\nshe ought to be happy. Her congratulations were warm and open; but Emma could\nnot speak so fluently. She was a little occupied in weighing her own\nfeelings, and trying to understand the degree of her agitation, which she\nrather thought was considerable.',
			'Mr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative to want\nothers to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did say, and soon moved\naway to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what\nthe whole room must have overheard already.',
			'It was well that he took every body’s joy for granted, or he might not\nhave thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularly delighted. They\nwere the first entitled, after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to be made\nhappy;—from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but she was so\ndeep in conversation with John Knightley, that it would have been too positive\nan interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton, and her attention\ndisengaged, he necessarily began on the subject with her.',
		],
		[
			'“I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to\nyou,” said Mr. Weston.',
			'Mrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by\nsuch a hope, smiled most graciously.',
			'“You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume,” he\ncontinued—“and know him to be my son, though he does not bear my\nname.”',
			'“Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance. I am sure Mr.\nElton will lose no time in calling on him; and we shall both have great\npleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage.”',
			'“You are very obliging.—Frank will be extremely happy, I am\nsure.— He is to be in town next week, if not sooner. We have notice of it\nin a letter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing my\nson’s hand, presumed to open it—though it was not directed to\nme—it was to Mrs. Weston. She is his principal correspondent, I assure\nyou. I hardly ever get a letter.”',
			'“And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her! Oh! Mr.\nWeston—(laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.—A most\ndangerous precedent indeed!—I beg you will not let your neighbours follow\nyour example.—Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect, we married\nwomen must begin to exert ourselves!—Oh! Mr. Weston, I could not have\nbelieved it of you!”',
			'“Aye, we men are sad fellows. You must take care of yourself, Mrs.\nElton.—This letter tells us—it is a short letter—written in a\nhurry, merely to give us notice—it tells us that they are all coming up\nto town directly, on Mrs. Churchill’s account—she has not been well\nthe whole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her—so they are all to\nmove southward without loss of time.”',
			'“Indeed!—from Yorkshire, I think. Enscombe is in Yorkshire?”',
			'“Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London, a\nconsiderable journey.”',
			'“Yes, upon my word, very considerable. Sixty-five miles farther than from\nMaple Grove to London. But what is distance, Mr. Weston, to people of large\nfortune?—You would be amazed to hear how my brother, Mr. Suckling,\nsometimes flies about. You will hardly believe me—but twice in one week\nhe and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four horses.”',
			'“The evil of the distance from Enscombe,” said Mr. Weston,\n“is, that Mrs. Churchill, as we understand, has not\nbeen able to leave the sofa for a week together. In Frank’s last letter\nshe complained, he said, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without\nhaving both his arm and his uncle’s! This, you know, speaks a great\ndegree of weakness—but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she\nmeans to sleep only two nights on the road.—So Frank writes word.\nCertainly, delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions, Mrs. Elton.\nYou must grant me that.”',
			'“No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing. I always take the part of my own\nsex. I do indeed. I give you notice—You will find me a formidable\nantagonist on that point. I always stand up for women—and I assure you,\nif you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn, you would not\nwonder at Mrs. Churchill’s making incredible exertions to avoid it.\nSelina says it is quite horror to her—and I believe I have caught a\nlittle of her nicety. She always travels with her own sheets; an excellent\nprecaution. Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?”',
			'“Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine lady\never did. Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land\nfor”—',
			'Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,',
			'“Oh! Mr. Weston, do not mistake me. Selina is no fine lady, I assure you.\nDo not run away with such an idea.”',
			'“Is not she? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is as thorough a\nfine lady as any body ever beheld.”',
			'Mrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly. It was\nby no means her object to have it believed that her sister was not a\nfine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it;—and\nshe was considering in what way she had best retract, when Mr. Weston went on.',
			'“Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may\nsuspect—but this is quite between ourselves. She is very fond of Frank,\nand therefore I would not speak ill of her. Besides, she is out of health now;\nbut that indeed, by her own account, she has always been. I would not\nsay so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much faith in Mrs.\nChurchill’s illness.”',
			'“If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?—To Bath, or\nto Clifton?” “She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too\ncold for her. The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe. She has\nnow been a longer time stationary there, than she ever was before, and she\nbegins to want change. It is a retired place. A fine place, but very\nretired.”',
			'“Aye—like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can stand more retired\nfrom the road than Maple Grove. Such an immense plantation all round it! You\nseem shut out from every thing—in the most complete retirement.—And\nMrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy that\nsort of seclusion. Or, perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to\nbe qualified for a country life. I always say a woman cannot have too many\nresources—and I feel very thankful that I have so many myself as to be\nquite independent of society.”',
			'“Frank was here in February for a fortnight.”',
			'“So I remember to have heard. He will find an addition to the\nsociety of Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume to call\nmyself an addition. But perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a\ncreature in the world.”',
			'This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and Mr. Weston, with\na very good grace, immediately exclaimed,',
			'“My dear madam! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible.\nNot heard of you!—I believe Mrs. Weston’s letters lately have been\nfull of very little else than Mrs. Elton.”',
			'He had done his duty and could return to his son.',
			'“When Frank left us,” continued he, “it was quite uncertain\nwhen we might see him again, which makes this day’s news doubly welcome.\nIt has been completely unexpected. That is, I always had a strong\npersuasion he would be here again soon, I was sure something favourable would\nturn up—but nobody believed me. He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully\ndesponding. ‘How could he contrive to come? And how could it be supposed\nthat his uncle and aunt would spare him again?’ and so forth—I\nalways felt that something would happen in our favour; and so it has, you see.\nI have observed, Mrs. Elton, in the course of my life, that if things are going\nuntowardly one month, they are sure to mend the next.”',
			'“Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true. It is just what I used to say to\na certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship, when, because things\ndid not go quite right, did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his\nfeelings, he was apt to be in despair, and exclaim that he was sure at this\nrate it would be May before Hymen’s saffron robe would be put on\nfor us. Oh! the pains I have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him\ncheerfuller views! The carriage—we had disappointments about the\ncarriage;—one morning, I remember, he came to me quite in despair.”',
			'She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly seized\nthe opportunity of going on.',
			'“You were mentioning May. May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill is\nordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place than\nEnscombe—in short, to spend in London; so that we have the agreeable\nprospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring—precisely the\nseason of the year which one should have chosen for it: days almost at the\nlongest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, and never too\nhot for exercise. When he was here before, we made the best of it; but there\nwas a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather; there always is in February,\nyou know, and we could not do half that we intended. Now will be the time. This\nwill be complete enjoyment; and I do not know, Mrs. Elton, whether the\nuncertainty of our meetings, the sort of constant expectation there will be of\nhis coming in to-day or to-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to\nhappiness than having him actually in the house. I think it is so. I think it\nis the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight. I hope you will be\npleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy. He is generally thought\na fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy. Mrs. Weston’s partiality\nfor him is very great, and, as you may suppose, most gratifying to me. She\nthinks nobody equal to him.”',
			'“And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my opinion\nwill be decidedly in his favour. I have heard so much in praise of Mr. Frank\nChurchill.—At the same time it is fair to observe, that I am one of those\nwho always judge for themselves, and are by no means implicitly guided by\nothers. I give you notice that as I find your son, so I shall judge of\nhim.—I am no flatterer.”',
			'Mr. Weston was musing.',
			'“I hope,” said he presently, “I have not been severe upon\npoor Mrs. Churchill. If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice; but\nthere are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak\nof her with the forbearance I could wish. You cannot be ignorant, Mrs. Elton,\nof my connexion with the family, nor of the treatment I have met with; and,\nbetween ourselves, the whole blame of it is to be laid to her. She was the\ninstigator. Frank’s mother would never have been slighted as she was but\nfor her. Mr. Churchill has pride; but his pride is nothing to his wife’s:\nhis is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody,\nand only make himself a little helpless and tiresome; but her pride is\narrogance and insolence! And what inclines one less to bear, she has no fair\npretence of family or blood. She was nobody when he married her, barely the\ndaughter of a gentleman; but ever since her being turned into a Churchill she\nhas out-Churchill’d them all in high and mighty claims: but in herself, I\nassure you, she is an upstart.”',
			'“Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking! I have quite a\nhorror of upstarts. Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of\nthat sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an\nannoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves! Your\ndescription of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them directly. People of the\nname of Tupman, very lately settled there, and encumbered with many low\nconnexions, but giving themselves immense airs, and expecting to be on a\nfooting with the old established families. A year and a half is the very utmost\nthat they can have lived at West Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody\nknows. They came from Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much, you\nknow, Mr. Weston. One has not great hopes from Birmingham. I always say there\nis something direful in the sound: but nothing more is positively known of the\nTupmans, though a good many things I assure you are suspected; and yet by their\nmanners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother, Mr. Suckling,\nwho happens to be one of their nearest neighbours. It is infinitely too bad.\nMr. Suckling, who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove, and whose\nfather had it before him—I believe, at least—I am almost sure that\nold Mr. Suckling had completed the purchase before his death.”',
			'They were interrupted. Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston, having said all\nthat he wanted, soon took the opportunity of walking away.',
			'After tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr. Woodhouse to\ncards. The remaining five were left to their own powers, and Emma doubted their\ngetting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed little disposed for\nconversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice, which nobody had inclination to\npay, and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer\nbeing silent.',
			'Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother. He was to leave them\nearly the next day; and he soon began with—',
			'“Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the\nboys; but you have your sister’s letter, and every thing is down at full\nlength there we may be sure. My charge would be much more concise than\nher’s, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have to\nrecommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physic them.”',
			'“I rather hope to satisfy you both,” said Emma, “for I shall\ndo all in my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella; and\nhappiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.”',
			'“And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again.”',
			'“That is very likely. You think so, do not you?”',
			'“I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father—or\neven may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements continue to\nincrease as much as they have done lately.”',
			'“Increase!”',
			'“Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made a great\ndifference in your way of life.”',
			'“Difference! No indeed I am not.”',
			'“There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than\nyou used to be. Witness this very time. Here am I come down for only one day,\nand you are engaged with a dinner-party!—When did it happen before, or\nany thing like it? Your neighbourhood is increasing, and you mix more with it.\nA little while ago, every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh\ngaieties; dinners at Mr. Cole’s, or balls at the Crown. The difference\nwhich Randalls, Randalls alone makes in your goings-on, is very great.”',
			'“Yes,” said his brother quickly, “it is Randalls that does it\nall.”',
			'“Very well—and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less\ninfluence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma, that Henry\nand John may be sometimes in the way. And if they are, I only beg you to send\nthem home.”',
			'“No,” cried Mr. Knightley, “that need not be the consequence.\nLet them be sent to Donwell. I shall certainly be at leisure.”',
			'“Upon my word,” exclaimed Emma, “you amuse me! I should like\nto know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being\nof the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to\nattend to the little boys. These amazing engagements of mine—what have\nthey been? Dining once with the Coles—and having a ball talked of, which\nnever took place. I can understand you—(nodding at Mr. John\nKnightley)—your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at\nonce here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed. But you, (turning to Mr.\nKnightley,) who know how very, very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield,\nwhy you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me, I cannot imagine.\nAnd as to my dear little boys, I must say, that if Aunt Emma has not time for\nthem, I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley, who is\nabsent from home about five hours where she is absent one—and who, when\nhe is at home, is either reading to himself or settling his accounts.”',
			'Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without\ndifficulty, upon Mrs. Elton’s beginning to talk to him.',
		],
		[
			'A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the nature of\nher agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill. She was soon convinced\nthat it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed;\nit was for him. Her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing; it\nwas not worth thinking of;—but if he, who had undoubtedly been always so\nmuch the most in love of the two, were to be returning with the same warmth of\nsentiment which he had taken away, it would be very distressing. If a\nseparation of two months should not have cooled him, there were dangers and\nevils before her:—caution for him and for herself would be necessary. She\ndid not mean to have her own affections entangled again, and it would be\nincumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.',
			'She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration. That\nwould be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance! and yet,\nshe could not help rather anticipating something decisive. She felt as if the\nspring would not pass without bringing a crisis, an event, a something to alter\nher present composed and tranquil state.',
			'It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen, before\nshe had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill’s feelings.\nThe Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined, but he\nwas at Highbury very soon afterwards. He rode down for a couple of hours; he\ncould not yet do more; but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield,\nshe could then exercise all her quick observation, and speedily determine how\nhe was influenced, and how she must act. They met with the utmost friendliness.\nThere could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her. But she had an\nalmost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done, of his feeling the\nsame tenderness in the same degree. She watched him well. It was a clear thing\nhe was less in love than he had been. Absence, with the conviction probably of\nher indifference, had produced this very natural and very desirable effect.',
			'He was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed\ndelighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old stories: and he was\nnot without agitation. It was not in his calmness that she read his comparative\nindifference. He was not calm; his spirits were evidently fluttered; there was\nrestlessness about him. Lively as he was, it seemed a liveliness that did not\nsatisfy himself; but what decided her belief on the subject, was his staying\nonly a quarter of an hour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury.\n“He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he\npassed—he had not stopped, he would not stop for more than a\nword—but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did\nnot call, and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield, he must hurry\noff.” She had no doubt as to his being less in love—but neither his\nagitated spirits, nor his hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure; and she\nwas rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power, and a\ndiscreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long.',
			'This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days. He was\noften hoping, intending to come—but was always prevented. His aunt could\nnot bear to have him leave her. Such was his own account at Randall’s. If\nhe were quite sincere, if he really tried to come, it was to be inferred that\nMrs. Churchill’s removal to London had been of no service to the wilful\nor nervous part of her disorder. That she was really ill was very certain; he\nhad declared himself convinced of it, at Randalls. Though much might be fancy,\nhe could not doubt, when he looked back, that she was in a weaker state of\nhealth than she had been half a year ago. He did not believe it to proceed from\nany thing that care and medicine might not remove, or at least that she might\nnot have many years of existence before her; but he could not be prevailed on,\nby all his father’s doubts, to say that her complaints were merely\nimaginary, or that she was as strong as ever.',
			'It soon appeared that London was not the place for her. She could not endure\nits noise. Her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering; and by the\nten days’ end, her nephew’s letter to Randalls communicated a\nchange of plan. They were going to remove immediately to Richmond. Mrs.\nChurchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there,\nand had otherwise a fancy for the place. A ready-furnished house in a favourite\nspot was engaged, and much benefit expected from the change.',
			'Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement, and\nseemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of\nsuch near neighbourhood to many dear friends—for the house was taken for\nMay and June. She was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of\nbeing often with them, almost as often as he could even wish.',
			'Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects. He was considering\nher as the source of all the happiness they offered. She hoped it was not so.\nTwo months must bring it to the proof.',
			'Mr. Weston’s own happiness was indisputable. He was quite delighted. It\nwas the very circumstance he could have wished for. Now, it would be really\nhaving Frank in their neighbourhood. What were nine miles to a young\nman?—An hour’s ride. He would be always coming over. The difference\nin that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make the whole difference\nof seeing him always and seeing him never. Sixteen miles—nay,\neighteen—it must be full eighteen to Manchester-street—was a\nserious obstacle. Were he ever able to get away, the day would be spent in\ncoming and returning. There was no comfort in having him in London; he might as\nwell be at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse.\nBetter than nearer!',
			'One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this\nremoval,—the ball at the Crown. It had not been forgotten before, but it\nhad been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day. Now, however, it was\nabsolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and very soon after the\nChurchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines from Frank, to say that his\naunt felt already much better for the change, and that he had no doubt of being\nable to join them for twenty-four hours at any given time, induced them to name\nas early a day as possible.',
			'Mr. Weston’s ball was to be a real thing. A very few to-morrows stood\nbetween the young people of Highbury and happiness.',
			'Mr. Woodhouse was resigned. The time of year lightened the evil to him. May was\nbetter for every thing than February. Mrs. Bates was engaged to spend the\nevening at Hartfield, James had due notice, and he sanguinely hoped that\nneither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have any thing the matter\nwith them, while dear Emma were gone.',
		],
		[
			'No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. The day approached, the day\narrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching, Frank Churchill, in all\nthe certainty of his own self, reached Randalls before dinner, and every thing\nwas safe.',
			'No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma. The room at the\nCrown was to witness it;—but it would be better than a common meeting in\na crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving\nthere as soon as possible after themselves, for the purpose of taking her\nopinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons\ncame, that she could not refuse him, and must therefore spend some quiet\ninterval in the young man’s company. She was to convey Harriet, and they\ndrove to the Crown in good time, the Randalls party just sufficiently before\nthem.',
			'Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did not say\nmuch, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening. They all\nwalked about together, to see that every thing was as it should be; and within\na few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage, which Emma could\nnot hear the sound of at first, without great surprize. “So unreasonably\nearly!” she was going to exclaim; but she presently found that it was a\nfamily of old friends, who were coming, like herself, by particular desire, to\nhelp Mr. Weston’s judgment; and they were so very closely followed by\nanother carriage of cousins, who had been entreated to come early with the same\ndistinguishing earnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as if half the\ncompany might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory\ninspection.',
			'Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr. Weston\ndepended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so\nmany intimates and confidantes, was not the very first distinction in the scale\nof vanity. She liked his open manners, but a little less of open-heartedness\nwould have made him a higher character.—General benevolence, but not\ngeneral friendship, made a man what he ought to be.—She could fancy such\na man. The whole party walked about, and looked, and praised again; and then,\nhaving nothing else to do, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to\nobserve in their various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though\nMay, a fire in the evening was still very pleasant.',
			'Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston’s fault that the number of privy\ncouncillors was not yet larger. They had stopped at Mrs. Bates’s door to\noffer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be brought by\nthe Eltons.',
			'Frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness, which\nshewed a mind not at ease. He was looking about, he was going to the door, he\nwas watching for the sound of other carriages,—impatient to begin, or\nafraid of being always near her.',
			'Mrs. Elton was spoken of. “I think she must be here soon,” said he.\n“I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much of her.\nIt cannot be long, I think, before she comes.”',
			'A carriage was heard. He was on the move immediately; but coming back, said,',
			'“I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her. I have never seen\neither Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myself forward.”',
			'Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed.',
			'“But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!” said Mr. Weston, looking about.\n“We thought you were to bring them.”',
			'The mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now. Emma longed to\nknow what Frank’s first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be; how he was\naffected by the studied elegance of her dress, and her smiles of graciousness.\nHe was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion, by giving her very\nproper attention, after the introduction had passed.',
			'In a few minutes the carriage returned.—Somebody talked of\nrain.—“I will see that there are umbrellas, sir,” said Frank\nto his father: “Miss Bates must not be forgotten:” and away he\nwent. Mr. Weston was following; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by\nher opinion of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man\nhimself, though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing.',
			'“A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly told you I\nshould form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased\nwith him.—You may believe me. I never compliment. I think him a very\nhandsome young man, and his manners are precisely what I like and\napprove—so truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism.\nYou must know I have a vast dislike to puppies—quite a horror of them.\nThey were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever\nany patience with them; and we used sometimes to say very cutting things!\nSelina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them much better.”',
			'While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston’s attention was chained; but when\nshe got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving\nto be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.',
			'Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. “I have no doubt of its being our\ncarriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are so extremely\nexpeditious!—I believe we drive faster than any body.—What a\npleasure it is to send one’s carriage for a friend!—I understand\nyou were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite unnecessary.\nYou may be very sure I shall always take care of them.”',
			'Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into the\nroom; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs. Weston’s\nto receive them. Her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who\nlooked on like Emma; but her words, every body’s words, were soon lost\nunder the incessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in talking, and had not\nfinished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle\nat the fire. As the door opened she was heard,',
			'“So very obliging of you!—No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I do\nnot care for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares—Well!—(as\nsoon as she was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed!—This is\nadmirable!—Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Could\nnot have imagined it.—So well lighted up!—Jane, Jane,\nlook!—did you ever see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really have\nhad Aladdin’s lamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again. I\nsaw her as I came in; she was standing in the entrance. ‘Oh! Mrs.\nStokes,’ said I—but I had not time for more.” She was now met\nby Mrs. Weston.—“Very well, I thank you, ma’am. I hope you\nare quite well. Very happy to hear it. So afraid you might have a\nheadache!—seeing you pass by so often, and knowing how much trouble you\nmust have. Delighted to hear it indeed. Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you\nfor the carriage!—excellent time. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep\nthe horses a moment. Most comfortable carriage.—Oh! and I am sure our\nthanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had most kindly\nsent Jane a note, or we should have been.—But two such offers in one\nday!—Never were such neighbours. I said to my mother, ‘Upon my\nword, ma’am—.’ Thank you, my mother is remarkably well. Gone\nto Mr. Woodhouse’s. I made her take her shawl—for the evenings are\nnot warm—her large new shawl— Mrs. Dixon’s\nwedding-present.—So kind of her to think of my mother! Bought at\nWeymouth, you know—Mr. Dixon’s choice. There were three others,\nJane says, which they hesitated about some time. Colonel Campbell rather\npreferred an olive. My dear Jane, are you sure you did not wet your\nfeet?—It was but a drop or two, but I am so afraid:—but Mr. Frank\nChurchill was so extremely—and there was a mat to step upon—I shall\nnever forget his extreme politeness.—Oh! Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell\nyou my mother’s spectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet\nnever came out again. My mother often talks of your good-nature. Does not she,\nJane?—Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?—Ah! here’s\nMiss Woodhouse.—Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you do?—Very well I\nthank you, quite well. This is meeting quite in fairy-land!—Such a\ntransformation!—Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma most\ncomplacently)—that would be rude—but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse,\nyou do look—how do you like Jane’s hair?—You are a\njudge.—She did it all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her\nhair!—No hairdresser from London I think could.—Ah! Dr. Hughes I\ndeclare—and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a\nmoment.—How do you do? How do you do?—Very well, I thank you. This\nis delightful, is not it?—Where’s dear Mr. Richard?—Oh! there\nhe is. Don’t disturb him. Much better employed talking to the young\nladies. How do you do, Mr. Richard?—I saw you the other day as you rode\nthrough the town—Mrs. Otway, I protest!—and good Mr. Otway, and\nMiss Otway and Miss Caroline.—Such a host of friends!—and Mr.\nGeorge and Mr. Arthur!—How do you do? How do you all do?—Quite\nwell, I am much obliged to you. Never better.—Don’t I hear another\ncarriage?—Who can this be?—very likely the worthy Coles.—Upon\nmy word, this is charming to be standing about among such friends! And such a\nnoble fire!—I am quite roasted. No coffee, I thank you, for\nme—never take coffee.—A little tea if you please, sir, by and\nbye,—no hurry—Oh! here it comes. Every thing so good!”',
			'Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss Bates was\nquiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs. Elton\nand Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little way behind her.—He was\nthoughtful. Whether he were overhearing too, she could not determine. After a\ngood many compliments to Jane on her dress and look, compliments very quietly\nand properly taken, Mrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented\nherself—and it was, “How do you like my gown?—How do you like\nmy trimming?—How has Wright done my hair?”—with many other\nrelative questions, all answered with patient politeness. Mrs. Elton then said,\n“Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do—but upon such\nan occasion as this, when every body’s eyes are so much upon me, and in\ncompliment to the Westons—who I have no doubt are giving this ball\nchiefly to do me honour—I would not wish to be inferior to others. And I\nsee very few pearls in the room except mine.—So Frank Churchill is a\ncapital dancer, I understand.—We shall see if our styles suit.—A\nfine young man certainly is Frank Churchill. I like him very well.”',
			'At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could not but\nimagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want to hear\nmore;—and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, till another\nsuspension brought Mrs. Elton’s tones again distinctly forward.—Mr.\nElton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,',
			'“Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?—I\nwas this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatient for\ntidings of us.”',
			'“Jane!”—repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and\ndispleasure.—“That is easy—but Miss Fairfax does not\ndisapprove it, I suppose.”',
			'“How do you like Mrs. Elton?” said Emma in a whisper.',
			'“Not at all.”',
			'“You are ungrateful.”',
			'“Ungrateful!—What do you mean?” Then changing from a frown to\na smile—“No, do not tell me—I do not want to know what you\nmean.—Where is my father?—When are we to begin dancing?”',
			'Emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. He walked off to\nfind his father, but was quickly back again with both Mr. and Mrs. Weston. He\nhad met with them in a little perplexity, which must be laid before Emma. It\nhad just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton must be asked to begin the\nball; that she would expect it; which interfered with all their wishes of\ngiving Emma that distinction.—Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude.',
			'“And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?” said Mr.\nWeston. “She will think Frank ought to ask her.”',
			'Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and boasted\nhimself an engaged man, which his father looked his most perfect approbation\nof—and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting him to dance\nwith Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business was to help to persuade him\ninto it, which was done pretty soon.—Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the\nway, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed. Emma must submit to stand\nsecond to Mrs. Elton, though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly\nfor her. It was almost enough to make her think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had\nundoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified; for\nthough she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could not lose by\nthe change. Mr. Weston might be his son’s superior.—In spite of\nthis little rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see the\nrespectable length of the set as it was forming, and to feel that she had so\nmany hours of unusual festivity before her.—She was more disturbed by Mr.\nKnightley’s not dancing than by any thing else.—There he was, among\nthe standers-by, where he ought not to be; he ought to be dancing,—not\nclassing himself with the husbands, and fathers, and whist-players, who were\npretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made\nup,—so young as he looked!—He could not have appeared to greater\nadvantage perhaps anywhere, than where he had placed himself. His tall, firm,\nupright figure, among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly\nmen, was such as Emma felt must draw every body’s eyes; and, excepting\nher own partner, there was not one among the whole row of young men who could\nbe compared with him.—He moved a few steps nearer, and those few steps\nwere enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner, with what natural grace, he\nmust have danced, would he but take the trouble.—Whenever she caught his\neye, she forced him to smile; but in general he was looking grave. She wished\nhe could love a ballroom better, and could like Frank Churchill\nbetter.—He seemed often observing her. She must not flatter herself that\nhe thought of her dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she did\nnot feel afraid. There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner.\nThey seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers. That Frank Churchill\nthought less of her than he had done, was indubitable.',
			'The ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessant attentions of\nMrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemed happy; and the praise of\nbeing a delightful ball, which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased\nto be, was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this. Of\nvery important, very recordable events, it was not more productive than such\nmeetings usually are. There was one, however, which Emma thought something\nof.—The two last dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had no\npartner;—the only young lady sitting down;—and so equal had been\nhitherto the number of dancers, that how there could be any one disengaged was\nthe wonder!—But Emma’s wonder lessened soon afterwards, on seeing\nMr. Elton sauntering about. He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were\npossible to be avoided: she was sure he would not—and she was expecting\nhim every moment to escape into the card-room.',
			'Escape, however, was not his plan. He came to the part of the room where the\nsitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in front of them, as\nif to shew his liberty, and his resolution of maintaining it. He did not omit\nbeing sometimes directly before Miss Smith, or speaking to those who were close\nto her.—Emma saw it. She was not yet dancing; she was working her way up\nfrom the bottom, and had therefore leisure to look around, and by only turning\nher head a little she saw it all. When she was half-way up the set, the whole\ngroup were exactly behind her, and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch;\nbut Mr. Elton was so near, that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which\njust then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived that his\nwife, who was standing immediately above her, was not only listening also, but\neven encouraging him by significant glances.—The kind-hearted, gentle\nMrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say, “Do not you dance, Mr.\nElton?” to which his prompt reply was, “Most readily, Mrs. Weston,\nif you will dance with me.”',
			'“Me!—oh! no—I would get you a better partner than myself. I\nam no dancer.”',
			'“If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,” said he, “I shall have\ngreat pleasure, I am sure—for, though beginning to feel myself rather an\nold married man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very great\npleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert.”',
			'“Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady\ndisengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing—Miss Smith.”\n“Miss Smith!—oh!—I had not observed.—You are extremely\nobliging—and if I were not an old married man.—But my dancing days\nare over, Mrs. Weston. You will excuse me. Any thing else I should be most\nhappy to do, at your command—but my dancing days are over.”',
			'Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and\nmortification she must be returning to her seat. This was Mr. Elton! the\namiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.—She looked round for a moment; he\nhad joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, and was arranging himself for\nsettled conversation, while smiles of high glee passed between him and his\nwife.',
			'She would not look again. Her heart was in a glow, and she feared her face\nmight be as hot.',
			'In another moment a happier sight caught her;—Mr. Knightley leading\nHarriet to the set!—Never had she been more surprized, seldom more\ndelighted, than at that instant. She was all pleasure and gratitude, both for\nHarriet and herself, and longed to be thanking him; and though too distant for\nspeech, her countenance said much, as soon as she could catch his eye again.',
			'His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it, extremely good; and\nHarriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had not been for the cruel\nstate of things before, and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense\nof the distinction which her happy features announced. It was not thrown away\non her, she bounded higher than ever, flew farther down the middle, and was in\na continual course of smiles.',
			'Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted) very\nfoolish. She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife, though growing\nvery like her;—she spoke some of her feelings, by observing\naudibly to her partner,',
			'“Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!—Very\ngood-natured, I declare.”',
			'Supper was announced. The move began; and Miss Bates might be heard from that\nmoment, without interruption, till her being seated at table and taking up her\nspoon.',
			'“Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?—Here is your tippet. Mrs.\nWeston begs you to put on your tippet. She says she is afraid there will be\ndraughts in the passage, though every thing has been done—One door nailed\nup—Quantities of matting—My dear Jane, indeed you must. Mr.\nChurchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you put it on!—so\ngratified! Excellent dancing indeed!—Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I said\nI should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and nobody missed\nme.—I set off without saying a word, just as I told you. Grandmama was\nquite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a vast deal of chat, and\nbackgammon.—Tea was made downstairs, biscuits and baked apples and wine\nbefore she came away: amazing luck in some of her throws: and she inquired a\ngreat deal about you, how you were amused, and who were your partners.\n‘Oh!’ said I, ‘I shall not forestall Jane; I left her dancing\nwith Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell you all about it herself\nto-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton, I do not know who will ask her\nnext, perhaps Mr. William Cox.’ My dear sir, you are too\nobliging.—Is there nobody you would not rather?—I am not helpless.\nSir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane on one arm, and me on the\nother!—Stop, stop, let us stand a little back, Mrs. Elton is going; dear\nMrs. Elton, how elegant she looks!—Beautiful lace!—Now we all\nfollow in her train. Quite the queen of the evening!—Well, here we are at\nthe passage. Two steps, Jane, take care of the two steps. Oh! no, there is but\none. Well, I was persuaded there were two. How very odd! I was convinced there\nwere two, and there is but one. I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and\nstyle—Candles everywhere.—I was telling you of your grandmama,\nJane,—There was a little disappointment.—The baked apples and\nbiscuits, excellent in their way, you know; but there was a delicate fricassee\nof sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first, and good Mr. Woodhouse,\nnot thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all out again. Now\nthere is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus—so\nshe was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would not speak of it to any\nbody, for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so\nvery much concerned!—Well, this is brilliant! I am all amazement! could\nnot have supposed any thing!—Such elegance and profusion!—I have\nseen nothing like it since—Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit?\nAnywhere, so that Jane is not in a draught. Where I sit is of no\nconsequence. Oh! do you recommend this side?—Well, I am sure, Mr.\nChurchill—only it seems too good—but just as you please. What you\ndirect in this house cannot be wrong. Dear Jane, how shall we ever recollect\nhalf the dishes for grandmama? Soup too! Bless me! I should not be helped so\nsoon, but it smells most excellent, and I cannot help beginning.”',
			'Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper; but,\nwhen they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes invited him irresistibly to\ncome to her and be thanked. He was warm in his reprobation of Mr. Elton’s\nconduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness; and Mrs. Elton’s looks also\nreceived the due share of censure.',
			'“They aimed at wounding more than Harriet,” said he. “Emma,\nwhy is it that they are your enemies?”',
			'He looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added,\n“She ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he may\nbe.—To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma, that\nyou did want him to marry Harriet.”',
			'“I did,” replied Emma, “and they cannot forgive me.”',
			'He shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, and he only\nsaid,',
			'“I shall not scold you. I leave you to your own reflections.”',
			'“Can you trust me with such flatterers?—Does my vain spirit ever\ntell me I am wrong?”',
			'“Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.—If one leads you\nwrong, I am sure the other tells you of it.”',
			'“I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton. There is\na littleness about him which you discovered, and which I did not: and I was\nfully convinced of his being in love with Harriet. It was through a series of\nstrange blunders!”',
			'“And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the justice\nto say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for\nhimself.—Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which Mrs. Elton is\ntotally without. An unpretending, single-minded, artless girl—infinitely\nto be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs. Elton. I\nfound Harriet more conversable than I expected.”',
			'Emma was extremely gratified.—They were interrupted by the bustle of Mr.\nWeston calling on every body to begin dancing again.',
			'“Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all\ndoing?—Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body is lazy!\nEvery body is asleep!”',
			'“I am ready,” said Emma, “whenever I am wanted.”',
			'“Whom are you going to dance with?” asked Mr. Knightley.',
			'She hesitated a moment, and then replied, “With you, if you will ask\nme.”',
			'“Will you?” said he, offering his hand.',
			'“Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are\nnot really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper.”',
			'“Brother and sister! no, indeed.”',

		[
			'This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable pleasure. It\nwas one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which she walked about the\nlawn the next morning to enjoy.—She was extremely glad that they had come\nto so good an understanding respecting the Eltons, and that their opinions of\nboth husband and wife were so much alike; and his praise of Harriet, his\nconcession in her favour, was peculiarly gratifying. The impertinence of the\nEltons, which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening,\nhad been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked\nforward to another happy result—the cure of Harriet’s\ninfatuation.—From Harriet’s manner of speaking of the circumstance\nbefore they quitted the ballroom, she had strong hopes. It seemed as if her\neyes were suddenly opened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not\nthe superior creature she had believed him. The fever was over, and Emma could\nharbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy.\nShe depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the\ndiscipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite.—Harriet\nrational, Frank Churchill not too much in love, and Mr. Knightley not wanting\nto quarrel with her, how very happy a summer must be before her!',
			'She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning. He had told her that he could\nnot allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield, as he was to be at\nhome by the middle of the day. She did not regret it.',
			'Having arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them all to\nrights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the\ndemands of the two little boys, as well as of their grandpapa, when the great\niron sweep-gate opened, and two persons entered whom she had never less\nexpected to see together—Frank Churchill, with Harriet leaning on his\narm—actually Harriet!—A moment sufficed to convince her that\nsomething extraordinary had happened. Harriet looked white and frightened, and\nhe was trying to cheer her.—The iron gates and the front-door were not\ntwenty yards asunder;—they were all three soon in the hall, and Harriet\nimmediately sinking into a chair fainted away.',
			'A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered, and\nsurprizes be explained. Such events are very interesting, but the suspense of\nthem cannot last long. A few minutes made Emma acquainted with the whole.',
			'Miss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs.\nGoddard’s, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together, and\ntaken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public enough for\nsafety, had led them into alarm.—About half a mile beyond Highbury,\nmaking a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms on each side, it became for a\nconsiderable stretch very retired; and when the young ladies had advanced some\nway into it, they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them, on a\nbroader patch of greensward by the side, a party of gipsies. A child on the\nwatch, came towards them to beg; and Miss Bickerton, excessively frightened,\ngave a great scream, and calling on Harriet to follow her, ran up a steep bank,\ncleared a slight hedge at the top, and made the best of her way by a short cut\nback to Highbury. But poor Harriet could not follow. She had suffered very much\nfrom cramp after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on\nsuch a return of it as made her absolutely powerless—and in this state,\nand exceedingly terrified, she had been obliged to remain.',
			'How the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been more courageous,\nmust be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted; and\nHarriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children, headed by a stout woman and\na great boy, all clamorous, and impertinent in look, though not absolutely in\nword.—More and more frightened, she immediately promised them money, and\ntaking out her purse, gave them a shilling, and begged them not to want more,\nor to use her ill.—She was then able to walk, though but slowly, and was\nmoving away—but her terror and her purse were too tempting, and she was\nfollowed, or rather surrounded, by the whole gang, demanding more.',
			'In this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling and conditioning,\nthey loud and insolent. By a most fortunate chance his leaving Highbury had\nbeen delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment. The\npleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward, and leave his\nhorses to meet him by another road, a mile or two beyond Highbury—and\nhappening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of Miss Bates,\nand to have forgotten to restore them, he had been obliged to stop at her door,\nand go in for a few minutes: he was therefore later than he had intended; and\nbeing on foot, was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them. The\nterror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then their own\nportion. He had left them completely frightened; and Harriet eagerly clinging\nto him, and hardly able to speak, had just strength enough to reach Hartfield,\nbefore her spirits were quite overcome. It was his idea to bring her to\nHartfield: he had thought of no other place.',
			'This was the amount of the whole story,—of his communication and of\nHarriet’s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.—He\ndared not stay longer than to see her well; these several delays left him not\nanother minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to\nMrs. Goddard, and notice of there being such a set of people in the\nneighbourhood to Mr. Knightley, he set off, with all the grateful blessings\nthat she could utter for her friend and herself.',
			'Such an adventure as this,—a fine young man and a lovely young woman\nthrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to\nthe coldest heart and the steadiest brain. So Emma thought, at least. Could a\nlinguist, could a grammarian, could even a mathematician have seen what she\ndid, have witnessed their appearance together, and heard their history of it,\nwithout feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly\ninteresting to each other?—How much more must an imaginist, like herself,\nbe on fire with speculation and foresight!—especially with such a\ngroundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made.',
			'It was a very extraordinary thing! Nothing of the sort had ever occurred before\nto any young ladies in the place, within her memory; no rencontre, no alarm of\nthe kind;—and now it had happened to the very person, and at the very\nhour, when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue\nher!—It certainly was very extraordinary!—And knowing, as she did,\nthe favourable state of mind of each at this period, it struck her the more. He\nwas wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself, she just recovering\nfrom her mania for Mr. Elton. It seemed as if every thing united to promise the\nmost interesting consequences. It was not possible that the occurrence should\nnot be strongly recommending each to the other.',
			'In the few minutes’ conversation which she had yet had with him, while\nHarriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her terror, her\nnaïveté, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with a sensibility\namused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet’s own account had\nbeen given, he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of Miss\nBickerton in the warmest terms. Every thing was to take its natural course,\nhowever, neither impelled nor assisted. She would not stir a step, nor drop a\nhint. No, she had had enough of interference. There could be no harm in a\nscheme, a mere passive scheme. It was no more than a wish. Beyond it she would\non no account proceed.',
			'Emma’s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what\nhad passed,—aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion: but she\nsoon felt that concealment must be impossible. Within half an hour it was known\nall over Highbury. It was the very event to engage those who talk most, the\nyoung and the low; and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the\nhappiness of frightful news. The last night’s ball seemed lost in the\ngipsies. Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat, and, as Emma had foreseen,\nwould scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the\nshrubbery again. It was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself\nand Miss Woodhouse (for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired\nafter), as well as Miss Smith, were coming in during the rest of the day; and\nhe had the pleasure of returning for answer, that they were all very\nindifferent—which, though not exactly true, for she was perfectly well,\nand Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with. She had an\nunhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man, for she hardly\nknew what indisposition was; and if he did not invent illnesses for her, she\ncould make no figure in a message.',
			'The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took themselves\noff in a hurry. The young ladies of Highbury might have walked again in safety\nbefore their panic began, and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of\nlittle importance but to Emma and her nephews:—in her imagination it\nmaintained its ground, and Henry and John were still asking every day for the\nstory of Harriet and the gipsies, and still tenaciously setting her right if\nshe varied in the slightest particular from the original recital.',
		],
		[
			'A very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came one morning\nto Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after sitting down and hesitating,\nthus began:',
			'“Miss Woodhouse—if you are at leisure—I have something that I\nshould like to tell you—a sort of confession to make—and then, you\nknow, it will be over.”',
			'Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak. There was a\nseriousness in Harriet’s manner which prepared her, quite as much as her\nwords, for something more than ordinary.',
			'“It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,” she continued,\n“to have no reserves with you on this subject. As I am happily quite an\naltered creature in one respect, it is very fit that you should\nhave the satisfaction of knowing it. I do not want to say more than is\nnecessary—I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and I\ndare say you understand me.”',
			'“Yes,” said Emma, “I hope I do.”',
			'“How I could so long a time be fancying myself!...” cried Harriet,\nwarmly. “It seems like madness! I can see nothing at all extraordinary in\nhim now.—I do not care whether I meet him or not—except that of the\ntwo I had rather not see him—and indeed I would go any distance round to\navoid him—but I do not envy his wife in the least; I neither admire her\nnor envy her, as I have done: she is very charming, I dare say, and all that,\nbut I think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable—I shall never forget\nher look the other night!—However, I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, I wish\nher no evil.—No, let them be ever so happy together, it will not give me\nanother moment’s pang: and to convince you that I have been speaking\ntruth, I am now going to destroy—what I ought to have destroyed long\nago—what I ought never to have kept—I know that very well (blushing\nas she spoke).—However, now I will destroy it all—and it is my\nparticular wish to do it in your presence, that you may see how rational I am\ngrown. Cannot you guess what this parcel holds?” said she, with a\nconscious look.',
			'“Not the least in the world.—Did he ever give you any thing?”',
			'“No—I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have\nvalued very much.”',
			'She held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words Most\nprecious treasures on the top. Her curiosity was greatly excited.\nHarriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience. Within\nabundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box, which Harriet\nopened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but, excepting the cotton,\nEmma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.',
			'“Now,” said Harriet, “you must recollect.”',
			'“No, indeed I do not.”',
			'“Dear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what\npassed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very last times we\never met in it!—It was but a very few days before I had my sore\nthroat—just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came—I think the\nvery evening.—Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new\npenknife, and your recommending court-plaister?—But, as you had none\nabout you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply him; and so I took mine out\nand cut him a piece; but it was a great deal too large, and he cut it smaller,\nand kept playing some time with what was left, before he gave it back to me.\nAnd so then, in my nonsense, I could not help making a treasure of it—so\nI put it by never to be used, and looked at it now and then as a great\ntreat.”',
			'“My dearest Harriet!” cried Emma, putting her hand before her face,\nand jumping up, “you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear.\nRemember it? Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving this\nrelic—I knew nothing of that till this moment—but the cutting the\nfinger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none about\nme!—Oh! my sins, my sins!—And I had plenty all the while in my\npocket!—One of my senseless tricks!—I deserve to be under a\ncontinual blush all the rest of my life.—Well—(sitting down\nagain)—go on—what else?”',
			'“And had you really some at hand yourself? I am sure I never suspected\nit, you did it so naturally.”',
			'“And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his\nsake!” said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided\nbetween wonder and amusement. And secretly she added to herself, “Lord\nbless me! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of\ncourt-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about! I never was equal\nto this.”',
			'“Here,” resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, “here is\nsomething still more valuable, I mean that has been more\nvaluable, because this is what did really once belong to him, which the\ncourt-plaister never did.”',
			'Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure. It was the end of an old\npencil,—the part without any lead.',
			'“This was really his,” said Harriet.—“Do not you\nremember one morning?—no, I dare say you do not. But one morning—I\nforget exactly the day—but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before\nthat evening, he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book;\nit was about spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about\nbrewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down; but when he took out his\npencil, there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away, and it would not\ndo, so you lent him another, and this was left upon the table as good for\nnothing. But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as I dared, caught it up, and\nnever parted with it again from that moment.”',
			'“I do remember it,” cried Emma; “I perfectly remember\nit.—Talking about spruce-beer.—Oh! yes—Mr. Knightley and I\nboth saying we liked it, and Mr. Elton’s seeming resolved to learn to\nlike it too. I perfectly remember it.—Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing\njust here, was not he? I have an idea he was standing just here.”',
			'“Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect.—It is very odd, but I\ncannot recollect.—Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember, much about\nwhere I am now.”—',
			'“Well, go on.”',
			'“Oh! that’s all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to\nsay—except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I\nwish you to see me do it.”',
			'“My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness in\ntreasuring up these things?”',
			'“Yes, simpleton as I was!—but I am quite ashamed of it now, and\nwish I could forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very wrong of me, you\nknow, to keep any remembrances, after he was married. I knew it was—but\nhad not resolution enough to part with them.”',
			'“But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?—I have\nnot a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be\nuseful.”',
			'“I shall be happier to burn it,” replied Harriet. “It has a\ndisagreeable look to me. I must get rid of every thing.—There it goes,\nand there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton.”',
			'“And when,” thought Emma, “will there be a beginning of Mr.\nChurchill?”',
			'She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made,\nand could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had told no fortune,\nmight be proved to have made Harriet’s.—About a fortnight after the\nalarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and quite undesignedly. Emma was\nnot thinking of it at the moment, which made the information she received more\nvaluable. She merely said, in the course of some trivial chat, “Well,\nHarriet, whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so”—and\nthought no more of it, till after a minute’s silence she heard Harriet\nsay in a very serious tone, “I shall never marry.”',
			'Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a moment’s\ndebate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied,',
			'“Never marry!—This is a new resolution.”',
			'“It is one that I shall never change, however.”',
			'After another short hesitation, “I hope it does not proceed from—I\nhope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?”',
			'“Mr. Elton indeed!” cried Harriet indignantly.—“Oh!\nno”—and Emma could just catch the words, “so superior to Mr.\nElton!”',
			'She then took a longer time for consideration. Should she proceed no\nfarther?—should she let it pass, and seem to suspect\nnothing?—Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did; or\nperhaps if she were totally silent, it might only drive Harriet into asking her\nto hear too much; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been,\nsuch an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, she was perfectly\nresolved.—She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once,\nall that she meant to say and know. Plain dealing was always best. She had\npreviously determined how far she would proceed, on any application of the\nsort; and it would be safer for both, to have the judicious law of her own\nbrain laid down with speed.—She was decided, and thus spoke—',
			'“Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. Your\nresolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from an idea\nthat the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly your superior in\nsituation to think of you. Is not it so?”',
			'“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to\nsuppose— Indeed I am not so mad.—But it is a pleasure to me to\nadmire him at a distance—and to think of his infinite superiority to all\nthe rest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so\nproper, in me especially.”',
			'“I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he rendered you\nwas enough to warm your heart.”',
			'“Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!—The very\nrecollection of it, and all that I felt at the time—when I saw him\ncoming—his noble look—and my wretchedness before. Such a change! In\none moment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect happiness!”',
			'“It is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable.—Yes,\nhonourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.—But that it will\nbe a fortunate preference is more than I can promise. I do not advise you to\ngive way to it, Harriet. I do not by any means engage for its being returned.\nConsider what you are about. Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your\nfeelings while you can: at any rate do not let them carry you far, unless you\nare persuaded of his liking you. Be observant of him. Let his behaviour be the\nguide of your sensations. I give you this caution now, because I shall never\nspeak to you again on the subject. I am determined against all interference.\nHenceforward I know nothing of the matter. Let no name ever pass our lips. We\nwere very wrong before; we will be cautious now.—He is your superior, no\ndoubt, and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature; but\nyet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there have been matches\nof greater disparity. But take care of yourself. I would not have you too\nsanguine; though, however it may end, be assured your raising your thoughts to\nhim, is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to\nvalue.”',
			'Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude. Emma was very\ndecided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend. Its\ntendency would be to raise and refine her mind—and it must be saving her\nfrom the danger of degradation.',

			'In this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened upon\nHartfield. To Highbury in general it brought no material change. The Eltons\nwere still talking of a visit from the Sucklings, and of the use to be made of\ntheir barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax was still at her grandmother’s;\nand as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed, and August,\ninstead of Midsummer, fixed for it, she was likely to remain there full two\nmonths longer, provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs. Elton’s\nactivity in her service, and save herself from being hurried into a delightful\nsituation against her will.',
			'Mr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had certainly taken\nan early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing to dislike him more. He\nbegan to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of Emma. That Emma\nwas his object appeared indisputable. Every thing declared it; his own\nattentions, his father’s hints, his mother-in-law’s guarded\nsilence; it was all in unison; words, conduct, discretion, and indiscretion,\ntold the same story. But while so many were devoting him to Emma, and Emma\nherself making him over to Harriet, Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of some\ninclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax. He could not understand it; but there\nwere symptoms of intelligence between them—he thought so at\nleast—symptoms of admiration on his side, which, having once observed, he\ncould not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning, however he might\nwish to escape any of Emma’s errors of imagination. She was not\npresent when the suspicion first arose. He was dining with the Randalls family,\nand Jane, at the Eltons’; and he had seen a look, more than a single\nlook, at Miss Fairfax, which, from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed\nsomewhat out of place. When he was again in their company, he could not help\nremembering what he had seen; nor could he avoid observations which, unless it\nwere like Cowper and his fire at twilight,',
			'“Myself creating what I saw,”',
			'brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private\nliking, of private understanding even, between Frank Churchill and Jane.',
			'He had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to spend his\nevening at Hartfield. Emma and Harriet were going to walk; he joined them; and,\non returning, they fell in with a larger party, who, like themselves, judged it\nwisest to take their exercise early, as the weather threatened rain; Mr. and\nMrs. Weston and their son, Miss Bates and her niece, who had accidentally met.\nThey all united; and, on reaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it was\nexactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father, pressed them\nall to go in and drink tea with him. The Randalls party agreed to it\nimmediately; and after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates, which few persons\nlistened to, she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse’s\nmost obliging invitation.',
			'As they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on horseback. The\ngentlemen spoke of his horse.',
			'“By the bye,” said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently,\n“what became of Mr. Perry’s plan of setting up his carriage?”',
			'Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, “I did not know that he ever had\nany such plan.”',
			'“Nay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it three months ago.”',
			'“Me! impossible!”',
			'“Indeed you did. I remember it perfectly. You mentioned it as what was\ncertainly to be very soon. Mrs. Perry had told somebody, and was extremely\nhappy about it. It was owing to her persuasion, as she thought his being\nout in bad weather did him a great deal of harm. You must remember it\nnow?”',
			'“Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment.”',
			'“Never! really, never!—Bless me! how could it be?—Then I must\nhave dreamt it—but I was completely persuaded—Miss Smith, you walk\nas if you were tired. You will not be sorry to find yourself at home.”',
			'“What is this?—What is this?” cried Mr. Weston, “about\nPerry and a carriage? Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank? I am glad\nhe can afford it. You had it from himself, had you?”',
			'“No, sir,” replied his son, laughing, “I seem to have had it\nfrom nobody.—Very odd!—I really was persuaded of Mrs.\nWeston’s having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many\nweeks ago, with all these particulars—but as she declares she never heard\na syllable of it before, of course it must have been a dream. I am a great\ndreamer. I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away—and when I have\ngone through my particular friends, then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs.\nPerry.”',
			'“It is odd though,” observed his father, “that you should\nhave had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very\nlikely you should be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry’s setting up his\ncarriage! and his wife’s persuading him to it, out of care for his\nhealth—just what will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other; only a\nlittle premature. What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream!\nAnd at others, what a heap of absurdities it is! Well, Frank, your dream\ncertainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent. Emma,\nyou are a great dreamer, I think?”',
			'Emma was out of hearing. She had hurried on before her guests to prepare her\nfather for their appearance, and was beyond the reach of Mr. Weston’s\nhint.',
			'“Why, to own the truth,” cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in\nvain to be heard the last two minutes, “if I must speak on this subject,\nthere is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have—I do not mean to\nsay that he did not dream it—I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams\nin the world—but if I am questioned about it, I must acknowledge that\nthere was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my\nmother, and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves—but it was quite a\nsecret, known to nobody else, and only thought of about three days. Mrs. Perry\nwas very anxious that he should have a carriage, and came to my mother in great\nspirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed. Jane, don’t\nyou remember grandmama’s telling us of it when we got home? I forget\nwhere we had been walking to—very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was\nto Randalls. Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother—indeed\nI do not know who is not—and she had mentioned it to her in confidence;\nshe had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not to go beyond:\nand, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of. At\nthe same time, I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint,\nbecause I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware. I am a talker,\nyou know; I am rather a talker; and now and then I have let a thing escape me\nwhich I should not. I am not like Jane; I wish I were. I will answer for it\nshe never betrayed the least thing in the world. Where is she?—Oh!\njust behind. Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry’s coming.—Extraordinary\ndream, indeed!”',
			'They were entering the hall. Mr. Knightley’s eyes had preceded Miss\nBates’s in a glance at Jane. From Frank Churchill’s face, where he\nthought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he had involuntarily\nturned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busy with her shawl. Mr.\nWeston had walked in. The two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her\npass. Mr. Knightley suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching\nher eye—he seemed watching her intently—in vain, however, if it\nwere so—Jane passed between them into the hall, and looked at neither.',
			'There was no time for farther remark or explanation. The dream must be borne\nwith, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern\ncircular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield, and which none but Emma\ncould have had power to place there and persuade her father to use, instead of\nthe small-sized Pembroke, on which two of his daily meals had, for forty years\nbeen crowded. Tea passed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to move.',
			'“Miss Woodhouse,” said Frank Churchill, after examining a table\nbehind him, which he could reach as he sat, “have your nephews taken away\ntheir alphabets—their box of letters? It used to stand here. Where is it?\nThis is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to be treated rather as\nwinter than summer. We had great amusement with those letters one morning. I\nwant to puzzle you again.”',
			'Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table was quickly\nscattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much disposed to employ\nas their two selves. They were rapidly forming words for each other, or for any\nbody else who would be puzzled. The quietness of the game made it particularly\neligible for Mr. Woodhouse, who had often been distressed by the more animated\nsort, which Mr. Weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily\noccupied in lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure of the\n“poor little boys,” or in fondly pointing out, as he took up any\nstray letter near him, how beautifully Emma had written it.',
			'Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She gave a slight glance\nround the table, and applied herself to it. Frank was next to Emma, Jane\nopposite to them—and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them all; and it\nwas his object to see as much as he could, with as little apparent observation.\nThe word was discovered, and with a faint smile pushed away. If meant to be\nimmediately mixed with the others, and buried from sight, she should have\nlooked on the table instead of looking just across, for it was not mixed; and\nHarriet, eager after every fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it\nup, and fell to work. She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for\nhelp. The word was blunder; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it,\nthere was a blush on Jane’s cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise\nostensible. Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream; but how it could all be,\nwas beyond his comprehension. How the delicacy, the discretion of his favourite\ncould have been so lain asleep! He feared there must be some decided\ninvolvement. Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every\nturn. These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick. It was a\nchild’s play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank Churchill’s\npart.',
			'With great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great alarm and\ndistrust, to observe also his two blinded companions. He saw a short word\nprepared for Emma, and given to her with a look sly and demure. He saw that\nEmma had soon made it out, and found it highly entertaining, though it was\nsomething which she judged it proper to appear to censure; for she said,\n“Nonsense! for shame!” He heard Frank Churchill next say, with a\nglance towards Jane, “I will give it to her—shall\nI?”—and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing\nwarmth. “No, no, you must not; you shall not, indeed.”',
			'It was done however. This gallant young man, who seemed to love without\nfeeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed over\nthe word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate civility\nentreated her to study it. Mr. Knightley’s excessive curiosity to know\nwhat this word might be, made him seize every possible moment for darting his\neye towards it, and it was not long before he saw it to be Dixon. Jane\nFairfax’s perception seemed to accompany his; her comprehension was\ncertainly more equal to the covert meaning, the superior intelligence, of those\nfive letters so arranged. She was evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing\nherself watched, blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her, and saying\nonly, “I did not know that proper names were allowed,” pushed away\nthe letters with even an angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no\nother word that could be offered. Her face was averted from those who had made\nthe attack, and turned towards her aunt.',
			'“Aye, very true, my dear,” cried the latter, though Jane had not\nspoken a word—“I was just going to say the same thing. It is time\nfor us to be going indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be\nlooking for us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. We really must wish you good\nnight.”',
			'Jane’s alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt had\npreconceived. She was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table; but so\nmany were also moving, that she could not get away; and Mr. Knightley thought\nhe saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her, and\nresolutely swept away by her unexamined. She was afterwards looking for her\nshawl—Frank Churchill was looking also—it was growing dusk, and the\nroom was in confusion; and how they parted, Mr. Knightley could not tell.',
			'He remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full of what he had\nseen; so full, that when the candles came to assist his observations, he\nmust—yes, he certainly must, as a friend—an anxious\nfriend—give Emma some hint, ask her some question. He could not see her\nin a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve her. It was his duty.',
			'“Pray, Emma,” said he, “may I ask in what lay the great\namusement, the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax? I\nsaw the word, and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to\nthe one, and so very distressing to the other.”',
			'Emma was extremely confused. She could not endure to give him the true\nexplanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed, she was really\nashamed of having ever imparted them.',
			'“Oh!” she cried in evident embarrassment, “it all meant\nnothing; a mere joke among ourselves.”',
			'“The joke,” he replied gravely, “seemed confined to you and\nMr. Churchill.”',
			'He had hoped she would speak again, but she did not. She would rather busy\nherself about any thing than speak. He sat a little while in doubt. A variety\nof evils crossed his mind. Interference—fruitless interference.\nEmma’s confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemed to declare her\naffection engaged. Yet he would speak. He owed it to her, to risk any thing\nthat might be involved in an unwelcome interference, rather than her welfare;\nto encounter any thing, rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause.',
			'“My dear Emma,” said he at last, with earnest kindness, “do\nyou think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the\ngentleman and lady we have been speaking of?”',
			'“Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax? Oh! yes,\nperfectly.—Why do you make a doubt of it?”',
			'“Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, or\nthat she admired him?”',
			'“Never, never!” she cried with a most open\neagerness—“Never, for the twentieth part of a moment, did such an\nidea occur to me. And how could it possibly come into your head?”',
			'“I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between\nthem—certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be\npublic.”',
			'“Oh! you amuse me excessively. I am delighted to find that you can\nvouchsafe to let your imagination wander—but it will not do—very\nsorry to check you in your first essay—but indeed it will not do. There\nis no admiration between them, I do assure you; and the appearances which have\ncaught you, have arisen from some peculiar circumstances—feelings rather\nof a totally different nature—it is impossible exactly to\nexplain:—there is a good deal of nonsense in it—but the part which\nis capable of being communicated, which is sense, is, that they are as far from\nany attachment or admiration for one another, as any two beings in the world\ncan be. That is, I presume it to be so on her side, and I can\nanswer for its being so on his. I will answer for the gentleman’s\nindifference.”',
			'She spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction which\nsilenced, Mr. Knightley. She was in gay spirits, and would have prolonged the\nconversation, wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions, every look\ndescribed, and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly\nentertained her: but his gaiety did not meet hers. He found he could not be\nuseful, and his feelings were too much irritated for talking. That he might not\nbe irritated into an absolute fever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse’s\ntender habits required almost every evening throughout the year, he soon\nafterwards took a hasty leave, and walked home to the coolness and solitude of\nDonwell Abbey.',

			'After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs. Suckling,\nthe Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that\nthey could not possibly come till the autumn. No such importation of novelties\ncould enrich their intellectual stores at present. In the daily interchange of\nnews, they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while\nthe Sucklings’ coming had been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs.\nChurchill, whose health seemed every day to supply a different report, and the\nsituation of Mrs. Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually\nbe as much increased by the arrival of a child, as that of all her neighbours\nwas by the approach of it.',
			'Mrs. Elton was very much disappointed. It was the delay of a great deal of\npleasure and parade. Her introductions and recommendations must all wait, and\nevery projected party be still only talked of. So she thought at\nfirst;—but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not\nbe put off. Why should not they explore to Box Hill though the Sucklings did\nnot come? They could go there again with them in the autumn. It was settled\nthat they should go to Box Hill. That there was to be such a party had been\nlong generally known: it had even given the idea of another. Emma had never\nbeen to Box Hill; she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing,\nand she and Mr. Weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither.\nTwo or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it\nwas to be done in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to\nthe bustle and preparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic parade\nof the Eltons and the Sucklings.',
			'This was so very well understood between them, that Emma could not but feel\nsome surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing from Mr. Weston that he had\nbeen proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her brother and sister had failed her, that\nthe two parties should unite, and go together; and that as Mrs. Elton had very\nreadily acceded to it, so it was to be, if she had no objection. Now, as her\nobjection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton, of which Mr.\nWeston must already be perfectly aware, it was not worth bringing forward\nagain:—it could not be done without a reproof to him, which would be\ngiving pain to his wife; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to\nan arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement\nwhich would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of\nMrs. Elton’s party! Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance of\nher outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her\nreflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston’s temper.',
			'“I am glad you approve of what I have done,” said he very\ncomfortably. “But I thought you would. Such schemes as these are nothing\nwithout numbers. One cannot have too large a party. A large party secures its\nown amusement. And she is a good-natured woman after all. One could not leave\nher out.”',
			'Emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.',
			'It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton was growing\nimpatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston as to pigeon-pies and\ncold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty.\nIt might be weeks, it might be only a few days, before the horse were useable;\nbut no preparations could be ventured on, and it was all melancholy stagnation.\nMrs. Elton’s resources were inadequate to such an attack.',
			'“Is not this most vexatious, Knightley?” she\ncried.—“And such weather for exploring!—These delays and\ndisappointments are quite odious. What are we to do?—The year will wear\naway at this rate, and nothing done. Before this time last year I assure you we\nhad had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston.”',
			'“You had better explore to Donwell,” replied Mr. Knightley.\n“That may be done without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries. They are\nripening fast.”',
			'If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so, for his\nproposal was caught at with delight; and the “Oh! I should like it of all\nthings,” was not plainer in words than manner. Donwell was famous for its\nstrawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for the invitation: but no plea was\nnecessary; cabbage-beds would have been enough to tempt the lady, who only\nwanted to be going somewhere. She promised him again and again to\ncome—much oftener than he doubted—and was extremely gratified by\nsuch a proof of intimacy, such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to\nconsider it.',
			'“You may depend upon me,” said she. “I certainly will come.\nName your day, and I will come. You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?”',
			'“I cannot name a day,” said he, “till I have spoken to some\nothers whom I would wish to meet you.”',
			'“Oh! leave all that to me. Only give me a carte-blanche.—I am Lady\nPatroness, you know. It is my party. I will bring friends with me.”',
			'“I hope you will bring Elton,” said he: “but I will not\ntrouble you to give any other invitations.”',
			'“Oh! now you are looking very sly. But consider—you need not be\nafraid of delegating power to me. I am no young lady on her preferment.\nMarried women, you know, may be safely authorised. It is my party. Leave it all\nto me. I will invite your guests.”',
			'“No,”—he calmly replied,—“there is but one\nmarried woman in the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she\npleases to Donwell, and that one is—”',
			'“—Mrs. Weston, I suppose,” interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather\nmortified.',
			'“No—Mrs. Knightley;—and till she is in being, I will manage\nsuch matters myself.”',
			'“Ah! you are an odd creature!” she cried, satisfied to have no one\npreferred to herself.—“You are a humourist, and may say what you\nlike. Quite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me—Jane and her\naunt.—The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all to meeting the\nHartfield family. Don’t scruple. I know you are attached to them.”',
			'“You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on Miss\nBates in my way home.”',
			'“That’s quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:—but as you\nlike. It is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing.\nI shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my\narm. Here,—probably this basket with pink ribbon. Nothing can be more\nsimple, you see. And Jane will have such another. There is to be no form or\nparade—a sort of gipsy party. We are to walk about your gardens, and\ngather the strawberries ourselves, and sit under trees;—and whatever else\nyou may like to provide, it is to be all out of doors—a table spread in\nthe shade, you know. Every thing as natural and simple as possible. Is not that\nyour idea?”',
			'“Not quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the\ntable spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and\nladies, with their servants and furniture, I think is best observed by meals\nwithin doors. When you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden, there\nshall be cold meat in the house.”',
			'“Well—as you please; only don’t have a great set out. And, by\nthe bye, can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our\nopinion?—Pray be sincere, Knightley. If you wish me to talk to Mrs.\nHodges, or to inspect anything—”',
			'“I have not the least wish for it, I thank you.”',
			'“Well—but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is\nextremely clever.”',
			'“I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever, and would\nspurn any body’s assistance.”',
			'“I wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us all to come on\ndonkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me—and my caro sposo walking by. I really\nmust talk to him about purchasing a donkey. In a country life I conceive it to\nbe a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have ever so many resources, it is not\npossible for her to be always shut up at home;—and very long walks, you\nknow—in summer there is dust, and in winter there is dirt.”',
			'“You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury. Donwell Lane is\nnever dusty, and now it is perfectly dry. Come on a donkey, however, if you\nprefer it. You can borrow Mrs. Cole’s. I would wish every thing to be as\nmuch to your taste as possible.”',
			'“That I am sure you would. Indeed I do you justice, my good friend. Under\nthat peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the warmest heart. As\nI tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.—Yes, believe me, Knightley,\nI am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme. You\nhave hit upon the very thing to please me.”',
			'Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade. He wished\nto persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party; and he knew that\nto have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him\nill. Mr. Woodhouse must not, under the specious pretence of a morning drive,\nand an hour or two spent at Donwell, be tempted away to his misery.',
			'He was invited on good faith. No lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his\neasy credulity. He did consent. He had not been at Donwell for two years.\n“Some very fine morning, he, and Emma, and Harriet, could go very well;\nand he could sit still with Mrs. Weston, while the dear girls walked about the\ngardens. He did not suppose they could be damp now, in the middle of the day.\nHe should like to see the old house again exceedingly, and should be very happy\nto meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and any other of his neighbours.—He could not\nsee any objection at all to his, and Emma’s, and Harriet’s going\nthere some very fine morning. He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to\ninvite them—very kind and sensible—much cleverer than dining\nout.—He was not fond of dining out.”',
			'Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body’s most ready concurrence. The\ninvitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like Mrs.\nElton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to\nthemselves.—Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure\nfrom it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over to join them, if\npossible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed\nwith.—Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see\nhim; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in writing, and spare no arguments\nto induce him to come.',
			'In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party to Box Hill\nwas again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell was settled for one\nday, and Box Hill for the next,—the weather appearing exactly right.',
			'Under a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse was safely\nconveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to partake of this al-fresco\nparty; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the Abbey, especially\nprepared for him by a fire all the morning, he was happily placed, quite at his\nease, ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved, and advise every\nbody to come and sit down, and not to heat themselves.—Mrs. Weston, who\nseemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired, and sit all the time with\nhim, remained, when all the others were invited or persuaded out, his patient\nlistener and sympathiser.',
			'It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she was\nsatisfied of her father’s comfort, she was glad to leave him, and look\naround her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular\nobservation, more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be\nso interesting to her and all her family.',
			'She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the\npresent and future proprietor could fairly warrant, as she viewed the\nrespectable size and style of the building, its suitable, becoming,\ncharacteristic situation, low and sheltered—its ample gardens stretching\ndown to meadows washed by a stream, of which the Abbey, with all the old\nneglect of prospect, had scarcely a sight—and its abundance of timber in\nrows and avenues, which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted\nup.—The house was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike it, covering\na good deal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many comfortable, and one\nor two handsome rooms.—It was just what it ought to be, and it looked\nwhat it was—and Emma felt an increasing respect for it, as the residence\nof a family of such true gentility, untainted in blood and\nunderstanding.—Some faults of temper John Knightley had; but Isabella had\nconnected herself unexceptionably. She had given them neither men, nor names,\nnor places, that could raise a blush. These were pleasant feelings, and she\nwalked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did,\nand collect round the strawberry-beds.—The whole party were assembled,\nexcepting Frank Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond; and\nMrs. Elton, in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet and her basket,\nwas very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or\ntalking—strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or\nspoken of.—“The best fruit in England—every body’s\nfavourite—always wholesome.—These the finest beds and finest\nsorts.—Delightful to gather for one’s self—the only way of\nreally enjoying them.—Morning decidedly the best time—never\ntired—every sort good—hautboy infinitely superior—no\ncomparison—the others hardly eatable—hautboys very\nscarce—Chili preferred—white wood finest flavour of all—price\nof strawberries in London—abundance about Bristol—Maple\nGrove—cultivation—beds when to be renewed—gardeners thinking\nexactly different—no general rule—gardeners never to be put out of\ntheir way—delicious fruit—only too rich to be eaten much\nof—inferior to cherries—currants more refreshing—only\nobjection to gathering strawberries the stooping—glaring sun—tired\nto death—could bear it no longer—must go and sit in the\nshade.”',
			'Such, for half an hour, was the conversation—interrupted only once by\nMrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her son-in-law, to inquire\nif he were come—and she was a little uneasy.—She had some fears of\nhis horse.',
			'Seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged to overhear\nwhat Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.—A situation, a most\ndesirable situation, was in question. Mrs. Elton had received notice of it that\nmorning, and was in raptures. It was not with Mrs. Suckling, it was not with\nMrs. Bragge, but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them: it was\nwith a cousin of Mrs. Bragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling, a lady known at\nMaple Grove. Delightful, charming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines,\nranks, every thing—and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with\nimmediately.—On her side, all was warmth, energy, and triumph—and\nshe positively refused to take her friend’s negative, though Miss Fairfax\ncontinued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing,\nrepeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before.—Still\nMrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the\nmorrow’s post.—How Jane could bear it at all, was astonishing to\nEmma.—She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly—and at last, with\na decision of action unusual to her, proposed a removal.—“Should\nnot they walk? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens—all the\ngardens?—She wished to see the whole extent.”—The pertinacity\nof her friend seemed more than she could bear.',
			'It was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered,\ndispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly followed one\nanother to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes, which\nstretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river, seemed the\nfinish of the pleasure grounds.—It led to nothing; nothing but a view at\nthe end over a low stone wall with high pillars, which seemed intended, in\ntheir erection, to give the appearance of an approach to the house, which never\nhad been there. Disputable, however, as might be the taste of such a\ntermination, it was in itself a charming walk, and the view which closed it\nextremely pretty.—The considerable slope, at nearly the foot of which the\nAbbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds; and at half\na mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed\nwith wood;—and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed and\nsheltered, rose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river\nmaking a close and handsome curve around it.',
			'It was a sweet view—sweet to the eye and the mind. English verdure,\nEnglish culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright, without being\noppressive.',
			'In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled; and towards\nthis view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet distinct from the\nrest, quietly leading the way. Mr. Knightley and Harriet!—It was an odd\ntête-à-tête; but she was glad to see it.—There had been a time when he\nwould have scorned her as a companion, and turned from her with little\nceremony. Now they seemed in pleasant conversation. There had been a time also\nwhen Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the\nAbbey Mill Farm; but now she feared it not. It might be safely viewed with all\nits appendages of prosperity and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading flocks,\norchard in blossom, and light column of smoke ascending.—She joined them\nat the wall, and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around. He\nwas giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc. and Emma\nreceived a smile which seemed to say, “These are my own concerns. I have\na right to talk on such subjects, without being suspected of introducing Robert\nMartin.”—She did not suspect him. It was too old a\nstory.—Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet.—They\ntook a few turns together along the walk.—The shade was most refreshing,\nand Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day.',
			'The next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;—and they\nwere all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did not come. Mrs. Weston\nlooked, and looked in vain. His father would not own himself uneasy, and\nlaughed at her fears; but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part\nwith his black mare. He had expressed himself as to coming, with more than\ncommon certainty. “His aunt was so much better, that he had not a doubt\nof getting over to them.”—Mrs. Churchill’s state, however, as\nmany were ready to remind her, was liable to such sudden variation as might\ndisappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependence—and Mrs. Weston\nwas at last persuaded to believe, or to say, that it must be by some attack of\nMrs. Churchill that he was prevented coming.—Emma looked at Harriet while\nthe point was under consideration; she behaved very well, and betrayed no\nemotion.',
			'The cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more to see what\nhad not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds; perhaps get as far as the\nclover, which was to be begun cutting on the morrow, or, at any rate, have the\npleasure of being hot, and growing cool again.—Mr. Woodhouse, who had\nalready taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens, where no\ndamps from the river were imagined even by him, stirred no more; and his\ndaughter resolved to remain with him, that Mrs. Weston might be persuaded away\nby her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need.',
			'Mr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse’s\nentertainment. Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos, corals, shells,\nand every other family collection within his cabinets, had been prepared for\nhis old friend, to while away the morning; and the kindness had perfectly\nanswered. Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused. Mrs. Weston had been\nshewing them all to him, and now he would shew them all to\nEmma;—fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child, than in a\ntotal want of taste for what he saw, for he was slow, constant, and\nmethodical.—Before this second looking over was begun, however, Emma\nwalked into the hall for the sake of a few moments’ free observation of\nthe entrance and ground-plot of the house—and was hardly there, when Jane\nFairfax appeared, coming quickly in from the garden, and with a look of\nescape.—Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there was a\nstart at first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of.',
			'“Will you be so kind,” said she, “when I am missed, as to say\nthat I am gone home?—I am going this moment.—My aunt is not aware\nhow late it is, nor how long we have been absent—but I am sure we shall\nbe wanted, and I am determined to go directly.—I have said nothing about\nit to any body. It would only be giving trouble and distress. Some are gone to\nthe ponds, and some to the lime walk. Till they all come in I shall not be\nmissed; and when they do, will you have the goodness to say that I am\ngone?”',
			'“Certainly, if you wish it;—but you are not going to walk to\nHighbury alone?”',
			'“Yes—what should hurt me?—I walk fast. I shall be at home in\ntwenty minutes.”',
			'“But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone. Let my\nfather’s servant go with you.—Let me order the carriage. It can be\nround in five minutes.”',
			'“Thank you, thank you—but on no account.—I would rather\nwalk.—And for me to be afraid of walking alone!—I, who may\nso soon have to guard others!”',
			'She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied, “That\ncan be no reason for your being exposed to danger now. I must order the\ncarriage. The heat even would be danger.—You are fatigued already.”',
			'“I am,”—she answered—“I am fatigued; but it is\nnot the sort of fatigue—quick walking will refresh me.—Miss\nWoodhouse, we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits. Mine, I\nconfess, are exhausted. The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let\nme have my own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary.”',
			'Emma had not another word to oppose. She saw it all; and entering into her\nfeelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately, and watched her safely\noff with the zeal of a friend. Her parting look was grateful—and her\nparting words, “Oh! Miss Woodhouse, the comfort of being sometimes\nalone!”—seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, and to describe\nsomewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her, even towards some\nof those who loved her best.',
			'“Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!” said Emma, as she turned back\ninto the hall again. “I do pity you. And the more sensibility you betray\nof their just horrors, the more I shall like you.”',
			'Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only accomplished\nsome views of St. Mark’s Place, Venice, when Frank Churchill entered the\nroom. Emma had not been thinking of him, she had forgotten to think of\nhim—but she was very glad to see him. Mrs. Weston would be at ease. The\nblack mare was blameless; they were right who had named Mrs. Churchill\nas the cause. He had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her; a\nnervous seizure, which had lasted some hours—and he had quite given up\nevery thought of coming, till very late;—and had he known how hot a ride\nhe should have, and how late, with all his hurry, he must be, he believed he\nshould not have come at all. The heat was excessive; he had never suffered any\nthing like it—almost wished he had staid at home—nothing killed him\nlike heat—he could bear any degree of cold, etc., but heat was\nintolerable—and he sat down, at the greatest possible distance from the\nslight remains of Mr. Woodhouse’s fire, looking very deplorable.',
			'“You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,” said Emma.',
			'“As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again. I could very ill be\nspared—but such a point had been made of my coming! You will all be going\nsoon I suppose; the whole party breaking up. I met one as I\ncame—Madness in such weather!—absolute madness!”',
			'Emma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill’s\nstate might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour.\nSome people were always cross when they were hot. Such might be his\nconstitution; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of\nsuch incidental complaints, she recommended his taking some refreshment; he\nwould find abundance of every thing in the dining-room—and she humanely\npointed out the door.',
			'“No—he should not eat. He was not hungry; it would only make him\nhotter.” In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour; and\nmuttering something about spruce-beer, walked off. Emma returned all her\nattention to her father, saying in secret—',
			'“I am glad I have done being in love with him. I should not like a man\nwho is so soon discomposed by a hot morning. Harriet’s sweet easy temper\nwill not mind it.”',
			'He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came back all\nthe better—grown quite cool—and, with good manners, like\nhimself—able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest in their\nemployment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he should be so late. He was\nnot in his best spirits, but seemed trying to improve them; and, at last, made\nhimself talk nonsense very agreeably. They were looking over views in\nSwisserland.',
			'“As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad,” said he.\n“I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will\nhave my sketches, some time or other, to look at—or my tour to\nread—or my poem. I shall do something to expose myself.”',
			'“That may be—but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never go\nto Swisserland. Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave\nEngland.”',
			'“They may be induced to go too. A warm climate may be prescribed for her.\nI have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad. I assure you I\nhave. I feel a strong persuasion, this morning, that I shall soon be abroad. I\nought to travel. I am tired of doing nothing. I want a change. I am serious,\nMiss Woodhouse, whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy—I am sick of\nEngland—and would leave it to-morrow, if I could.”',
			'“You are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a few\nhardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?”',
			'“I sick of prosperity and indulgence! You are quite mistaken. I do\nnot look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged. I am thwarted in every\nthing material. I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person.”',
			'“You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came. Go and\neat and drink a little more, and you will do very well. Another slice of cold\nmeat, another draught of Madeira and water, will make you nearly on a par with\nthe rest of us.”',
			'“No—I shall not stir. I shall sit by you. You are my best\ncure.”',
			'“We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;—you will join us. It is not\nSwisserland, but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a\nchange. You will stay, and go with us?”',
			'“No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening.”',
			'“But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning.”',
			'“No—It will not be worth while. If I come, I shall be cross.”',
			'“Then pray stay at Richmond.”',
			'“But if I do, I shall be crosser still. I can never bear to think of you\nall there without me.”',
			'“These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself. Chuse your\nown degree of crossness. I shall press you no more.”',
			'The rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected. With\nsome there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill; others took it very\ncomposedly; but there was a very general distress and disturbance on Miss\nFairfax’s disappearance being explained. That it was time for every body\nto go, concluded the subject; and with a short final arrangement for the next\nday’s scheme, they parted. Frank Churchill’s little inclination to\nexclude himself increased so much, that his last words to Emma were,',
			'“Well;—if you wish me to stay and join the party, I\nwill.”',
			'She smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from Richmond was to\ntake him back before the following evening.',
		],
		[
			'They had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward circumstances\nof arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were in favour of a pleasant\nparty. Mr. Weston directed the whole, officiating safely between Hartfield and\nthe Vicarage, and every body was in good time. Emma and Harriet went together;\nMiss Bates and her niece, with the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. Mrs.\nWeston remained with Mr. Woodhouse. Nothing was wanting but to be happy when\nthey got there. Seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and\nevery body had a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general\namount of the day there was deficiency. There was a languor, a want of spirits,\na want of union, which could not be got over. They separated too much into\nparties. The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took charge of Miss Bates\nand Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill. And Mr. Weston\ntried, in vain, to make them harmonise better. It seemed at first an accidental\ndivision, but it never materially varied. Mr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no\nunwillingness to mix, and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two\nwhole hours that were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle of\nseparation, between the other parties, too strong for any fine prospects, or\nany cold collation, or any cheerful Mr. Weston, to remove.',
			'At first it was downright dulness to Emma. She had never seen Frank Churchill\nso silent and stupid. He said nothing worth hearing—looked without\nseeing—admired without intelligence—listened without knowing what\nshe said. While he was so dull, it was no wonder that Harriet should be dull\nlikewise; and they were both insufferable.',
			'When they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better, for\nFrank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first object. Every\ndistinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to her. To amuse her, and\nbe agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he cared for—and Emma, glad to\nbe enlivened, not sorry to be flattered, was gay and easy too, and gave him all\nthe friendly encouragement, the admission to be gallant, which she had ever\ngiven in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance; but which\nnow, in her own estimation, meant nothing, though in the judgment of most\npeople looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but\nflirtation could very well describe. “Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss\nWoodhouse flirted together excessively.” They were laying themselves open\nto that very phrase—and to having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove\nby one lady, to Ireland by another. Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from\nany real felicity; it was rather because she felt less happy than she had\nexpected. She laughed because she was disappointed; and though she liked him\nfor his attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship, admiration, or\nplayfulness, extremely judicious, they were not winning back her heart. She\nstill intended him for her friend.',
			'“How much I am obliged to you,” said he, “for telling me to\ncome to-day!—If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all\nthe happiness of this party. I had quite determined to go away again.”',
			'“Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except that you\nwere too late for the best strawberries. I was a kinder friend than you\ndeserved. But you were humble. You begged hard to be commanded to come.”',
			'“Don’t say I was cross. I was fatigued. The heat overcame\nme.”',
			'“It is hotter to-day.”',
			'“Not to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable to-day.”',
			'“You are comfortable because you are under command.”',
			'“Your command?—Yes.”',
			'“Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had,\nsomehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your own\nmanagement; but to-day you are got back again—and as I cannot be always\nwith you, it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than\nmine.”',
			'“It comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command without a motive.\nYou order me, whether you speak or not. And you can be always with me. You are\nalways with me.”',
			'“Dating from three o’clock yesterday. My perpetual influence could\nnot begin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of humour\nbefore.”',
			'“Three o’clock yesterday! That is your date. I thought I had seen\nyou first in February.”',
			'“Your gallantry is really unanswerable. But (lowering her\nvoice)—nobody speaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be\ntalking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people.”',
			'“I say nothing of which I am ashamed,” replied he, with lively\nimpudence. “I saw you first in February. Let every body on the Hill hear\nme if they can. Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side, and Dorking on\nthe other. I saw you first in February.” And then\nwhispering—“Our companions are excessively stupid. What shall we do\nto rouse them? Any nonsense will serve. They shall talk. Ladies and\ngentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is, presides) to\nsay, that she desires to know what you are all thinking of?”',
			'Some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great deal; Mrs.\nElton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse’s presiding; Mr.\nKnightley’s answer was the most distinct.',
			'“Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all\nthinking of?”',
			'“Oh! no, no”—cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she\ncould—“Upon no account in the world. It is the very last thing I\nwould stand the brunt of just now. Let me hear any thing rather than what you\nare all thinking of. I will not say quite all. There are one or two, perhaps,\n(glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet,) whose thoughts I might not be afraid of\nknowing.”',
			'“It is a sort of thing,” cried Mrs. Elton emphatically,\n“which I should not have thought myself privileged to inquire\ninto. Though, perhaps, as the Chaperon of the party—I never\nwas in any circle—exploring parties—young ladies—married\nwomen—”',
			'Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured, in reply,',
			'“Very true, my love, very true. Exactly so, indeed—quite unheard\nof—but some ladies say any thing. Better pass it off as a joke. Every\nbody knows what is due to you.”',
			'“It will not do,” whispered Frank to Emma; “they are most of\nthem affronted. I will attack them with more address. Ladies and\ngentlemen—I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she waives her\nright of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of, and only requires\nsomething very entertaining from each of you, in a general way. Here are seven\nof you, besides myself, (who, she is pleased to say, am very entertaining\nalready,) and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever,\nbe it prose or verse, original or repeated—or two things moderately\nclever—or three things very dull indeed, and she engages to laugh\nheartily at them all.”',
			'“Oh! very well,” exclaimed Miss Bates, “then I need not be\nuneasy. ‘Three things very dull indeed.’ That will just do for me,\nyou know. I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my\nmouth, shan’t I? (looking round with the most good-humoured dependence on\nevery body’s assent)—Do not you all think I shall?”',
			'Emma could not resist.',
			'“Ah! ma’am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon me—but you\nwill be limited as to number—only three at once.”',
			'Miss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not immediately\ncatch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could not anger, though a\nslight blush shewed that it could pain her.',
			'“Ah!—well—to be sure. Yes, I see what she means, (turning to\nMr. Knightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue. I must make myself very\ndisagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend.”',
			'“I like your plan,” cried Mr. Weston. “Agreed, agreed. I will\ndo my best. I am making a conundrum. How will a conundrum reckon?”',
			'“Low, I am afraid, sir, very low,” answered his\nson;—“but we shall be indulgent—especially to any one who\nleads the way.”',
			'“No, no,” said Emma, “it will not reckon low. A conundrum of\nMr. Weston’s shall clear him and his next neighbour. Come, sir, pray let\nme hear it.”',
			'“I doubt its being very clever myself,” said Mr. Weston. “It\nis too much a matter of fact, but here it is.—What two letters of the\nalphabet are there, that express perfection?”',
			'“What two letters!—express perfection! I am sure I do not\nknow.”',
			'“Ah! you will never guess. You, (to Emma), I am certain, will never\nguess.—I will tell you.—M. and A.—Em-ma.—Do you\nunderstand?”',
			'Understanding and gratification came together. It might be a very indifferent\npiece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it—and\nso did Frank and Harriet.—It did not seem to touch the rest of the party\nequally; some looked very stupid about it, and Mr. Knightley gravely said,',
			'“This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston\nhas done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every body else.\nPerfection should not have come quite so soon.”',
			'“Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused,” said Mrs. Elton;\n“I really cannot attempt—I am not at all fond of the sort of\nthing. I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not at\nall pleased with. I knew who it came from. An abominable puppy!—You know\nwho I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things are very well at\nChristmas, when one is sitting round the fire; but quite out of place, in my\nopinion, when one is exploring about the country in summer. Miss Woodhouse must\nexcuse me. I am not one of those who have witty things at every body’s\nservice. I do not pretend to be a wit. I have a great deal of vivacity in my\nown way, but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold\nmy tongue. Pass us, if you please, Mr. Churchill. Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane,\nand myself. We have nothing clever to say—not one of us.',
			'“Yes, yes, pray pass me,” added her husband, with a sort of\nsneering consciousness; “I have nothing to say that can entertain\nMiss Woodhouse, or any other young lady. An old married man—quite good\nfor nothing. Shall we walk, Augusta?”',
			'“With all my heart. I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot.\nCome, Jane, take my other arm.”',
			'Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off. “Happy\ncouple!” said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out of\nhearing:—“How well they suit one another!—Very\nlucky—marrying as they did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public\nplace!—They only knew each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath!\nPeculiarly lucky!—for as to any real knowledge of a person’s\ndisposition that Bath, or any public place, can give—it is all nothing;\nthere can be no knowledge. It is only by seeing women in their own homes, among\ntheir own set, just as they always are, that you can form any just judgment.\nShort of that, it is all guess and luck—and will generally be ill-luck.\nHow many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance, and rued it all\nthe rest of his life!”',
			'Miss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her own confederates,\nspoke now.',
			'“Such things do occur, undoubtedly.”—She was stopped by a\ncough. Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen.',
			'“You were speaking,” said he, gravely. She recovered her voice.',
			'“I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstances\ndo sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot imagine them to be very\nfrequent. A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise—but there is\ngenerally time to recover from it afterwards. I would be understood to mean,\nthat it can be only weak, irresolute characters, (whose happiness must be\nalways at the mercy of chance,) who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to\nbe an inconvenience, an oppression for ever.”',
			'He made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon afterwards\nsaid, in a lively tone,',
			'“Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever I\nmarry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me. Will you? (turning to Emma.)\nWill you chuse a wife for me?—I am sure I should like any body fixed on\nby you. You provide for the family, you know, (with a smile at his father).\nFind some body for me. I am in no hurry. Adopt her, educate her.”',
			'“And make her like myself.”',
			'“By all means, if you can.”',
			'“Very well. I undertake the commission. You shall have a charming\nwife.”',
			'“She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for nothing else. I\nshall go abroad for a couple of years—and when I return, I shall come to\nyou for my wife. Remember.”',
			'Emma was in no danger of forgetting. It was a commission to touch every\nfavourite feeling. Would not Harriet be the very creature described? Hazle eyes\nexcepted, two years more might make her all that he wished. He might even have\nHarriet in his thoughts at the moment; who could say? Referring the education\nto her seemed to imply it.',
			'“Now, ma’am,” said Jane to her aunt, “shall we join\nMrs. Elton?”',
			'“If you please, my dear. With all my heart. I am quite ready. I was ready\nto have gone with her, but this will do just as well. We shall soon overtake\nher. There she is—no, that’s somebody else. That’s one of the\nladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her.—Well, I\ndeclare—”',
			'They walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley. Mr. Weston, his\nson, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young man’s spirits now\nrose to a pitch almost unpleasant. Even Emma grew tired at last of flattery and\nmerriment, and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the\nothers, or sitting almost alone, and quite unattended to, in tranquil\nobservation of the beautiful views beneath her. The appearance of the servants\nlooking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight; and\neven the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart, and the solicitude of\nMrs. Elton to have her carriage first, were gladly endured, in the\nprospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable\nenjoyments of this day of pleasure. Such another scheme, composed of so many\nill-assorted people, she hoped never to be betrayed into again.',
			'While waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side. He looked\naround, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,',
			'“Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: a\nprivilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still use it. I\ncannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. How could you be so\nunfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of\nher character, age, and situation?—Emma, I had not thought it\npossible.”',
			'Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.',
			'“Nay, how could I help saying what I did?—Nobody could have helped\nit. It was not so very bad. I dare say she did not understand me.”',
			'“I assure you she did. She felt your full meaning. She has talked of it\nsince. I wish you could have heard how she talked of it—with what candour\nand generosity. I wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance, in\nbeing able to pay her such attentions, as she was for ever receiving from\nyourself and your father, when her society must be so irksome.”',
			'“Oh!” cried Emma, “I know there is not a better creature in\nthe world: but you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are\nmost unfortunately blended in her.”',
			'“They are blended,” said he, “I acknowledge; and, were she\nprosperous, I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous\nover the good. Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every harmless\nabsurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of\nmanner. Were she your equal in situation—but, Emma, consider how far this\nis from being the case. She is poor; she has sunk from the comforts she was\nborn to; and, if she live to old age, must probably sink more. Her situation\nshould secure your compassion. It was badly done, indeed! You, whom she had\nknown from an infant, whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice\nwas an honour, to have you now, in thoughtless spirits, and the pride of the\nmoment, laugh at her, humble her—and before her niece, too—and\nbefore others, many of whom (certainly some,) would be entirely guided\nby your treatment of her.—This is not pleasant to you,\nEmma—and it is very far from pleasant to me; but I must, I will,—I\nwill tell you truths while I can; satisfied with proving myself your friend by\nvery faithful counsel, and trusting that you will some time or other do me\ngreater justice than you can do now.”',
			'While they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage; it was ready; and,\nbefore she could speak again, he had handed her in. He had misinterpreted the\nfeelings which had kept her face averted, and her tongue motionless. They were\ncombined only of anger against herself, mortification, and deep concern. She\nhad not been able to speak; and, on entering the carriage, sunk back for a\nmoment overcome—then reproaching herself for having taken no leave,\nmaking no acknowledgment, parting in apparent sullenness, she looked out with\nvoice and hand eager to shew a difference; but it was just too late. He had\nturned away, and the horses were in motion. She continued to look back, but in\nvain; and soon, with what appeared unusual speed, they were half way down the\nhill, and every thing left far behind. She was vexed beyond what could have\nbeen expressed—almost beyond what she could conceal. Never had she felt\nso agitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance in her life. She was most\nforcibly struck. The truth of this representation there was no denying. She\nfelt it at her heart. How could she have been so brutal, so cruel to Miss\nBates! How could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she\nvalued! And how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude,\nof concurrence, of common kindness!',
			'Time did not compose her. As she reflected more, she seemed but to feel it\nmore. She never had been so depressed. Happily it was not necessary to speak.\nThere was only Harriet, who seemed not in spirits herself, fagged, and very\nwilling to be silent; and Emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost\nall the way home, without being at any trouble to check them, extraordinary as\nthey were.',

		[
			'The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma’s thoughts all the\nevening. How it might be considered by the rest of the party, she could not\ntell. They, in their different homes, and their different ways, might be\nlooking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it was a morning more\ncompletely misspent, more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time,\nand more to be abhorred in recollection, than any she had ever passed. A whole\nevening of back-gammon with her father, was felicity to it. There,\nindeed, lay real pleasure, for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of\nthe twenty-four to his comfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the\ndegree of his fond affection and confiding esteem, she could not, in her\ngeneral conduct, be open to any severe reproach. As a daughter, she hoped she\nwas not without a heart. She hoped no one could have said to her, “How\ncould you be so unfeeling to your father?—I must, I will tell you truths\nwhile I can.” Miss Bates should never again—no, never! If\nattention, in future, could do away the past, she might hope to be forgiven.\nShe had been often remiss, her conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in\nthought than fact; scornful, ungracious. But it should be so no more. In the\nwarmth of true contrition, she would call upon her the very next morning, and\nit should be the beginning, on her side, of a regular, equal, kindly\nintercourse.',
			'She was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early, that nothing\nmight prevent her. It was not unlikely, she thought, that she might see Mr.\nKnightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might come in while she were paying her\nvisit. She had no objection. She would not be ashamed of the appearance of the\npenitence, so justly and truly hers. Her eyes were towards Donwell as she\nwalked, but she saw him not.',
			'“The ladies were all at home.” She had never rejoiced at the sound\nbefore, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs, with any\nwish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation, or of deriving it,\nexcept in subsequent ridicule.',
			'There was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking. She\nheard Miss Bates’s voice, something was to be done in a hurry; the maid\nlooked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment, and\nthen ushered her in too soon. The aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the\nadjoining room. Jane she had a distinct glimpse of, looking extremely ill; and,\nbefore the door had shut them out, she heard Miss Bates saying, “Well, my\ndear, I shall say you are laid down upon the bed, and I am sure you are\nill enough.”',
			'Poor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she did not quite\nunderstand what was going on.',
			'“I am afraid Jane is not very well,” said she, “but I do not\nknow; they tell me she is well. I dare say my daughter will be here\npresently, Miss Woodhouse. I hope you find a chair. I wish Hetty had not gone.\nI am very little able—Have you a chair, ma’am? Do you sit where you\nlike? I am sure she will be here presently.”',
			'Emma seriously hoped she would. She had a moment’s fear of Miss Bates\nkeeping away from her. But Miss Bates soon came—“Very happy and\nobliged”—but Emma’s conscience told her that there was not\nthe same cheerful volubility as before—less ease of look and manner. A\nvery friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead the way to a\nreturn of old feelings. The touch seemed immediate.',
			'“Ah! Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!—I suppose you have\nheard—and are come to give us joy. This does not seem much like joy,\nindeed, in me—(twinkling away a tear or two)—but it will be very\ntrying for us to part with her, after having had her so long, and she has a\ndreadful headache just now, writing all the morning:—such long letters,\nyou know, to be written to Colonel Campbell, and Mrs. Dixon. ‘My\ndear,’ said I, ‘you will blind yourself’—for tears were\nin her eyes perpetually. One cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. It is a great\nchange; and though she is amazingly fortunate—such a situation, I\nsuppose, as no young woman before ever met with on first going out—do not\nthink us ungrateful, Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good\nfortune—(again dispersing her tears)—but, poor dear soul! if you\nwere to see what a headache she has. When one is in great pain, you know one\ncannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve. She is as low as possible. To\nlook at her, nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured\nsuch a situation. You will excuse her not coming to you—she is not\nable—she is gone into her own room—I want her to lie down upon the\nbed. ‘My dear,’ said I, ‘I shall say you are laid down upon\nthe bed:’ but, however, she is not; she is walking about the room. But,\nnow that she has written her letters, she says she shall soon be well. She will\nbe extremely sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but your kindness will\nexcuse her. You were kept waiting at the door—I was quite\nashamed—but somehow there was a little bustle—for it so happened\nthat we had not heard the knock, and till you were on the stairs, we did not\nknow any body was coming. ‘It is only Mrs. Cole,’ said I,\n‘depend upon it. Nobody else would come so early.’\n‘Well,’ said she, ‘it must be borne some time or other, and\nit may as well be now.’ But then Patty came in, and said it was you.\n‘Oh!’ said I, ‘it is Miss Woodhouse: I am sure you will like\nto see her.’—‘I can see nobody,’ said she; and up she\ngot, and would go away; and that was what made us keep you waiting—and\nextremely sorry and ashamed we were. ‘If you must go, my dear,’\nsaid I, ‘you must, and I will say you are laid down upon the\nbed.’”',
			'Emma was most sincerely interested. Her heart had been long growing kinder\ntowards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of\nevery former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing but pity; and the\nremembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past, obliged\nher to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any\nother steady friend, when she might not bear to see herself. She spoke as she\nfelt, with earnest regret and solicitude—sincerely wishing that the\ncircumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined\non, might be as much for Miss Fairfax’s advantage and comfort as\npossible. “It must be a severe trial to them all. She had understood it\nwas to be delayed till Colonel Campbell’s return.”',
			'“So very kind!” replied Miss Bates. “But you are always\nkind.”',
			'There was no bearing such an “always;” and to break through her\ndreadful gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of—',
			'“Where—may I ask?—is Miss Fairfax going?”',
			'“To a Mrs. Smallridge—charming woman—most superior—to\nhave the charge of her three little girls—delightful children. Impossible\nthat any situation could be more replete with comfort; if we except, perhaps,\nMrs. Suckling’s own family, and Mrs. Bragge’s; but Mrs. Smallridge\nis intimate with both, and in the very same neighbourhood:—lives only\nfour miles from Maple Grove. Jane will be only four miles from Maple\nGrove.”',
			'“Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax\nowes—”',
			'“Yes, our good Mrs. Elton. The most indefatigable, true friend. She would\nnot take a denial. She would not let Jane say, ‘No;’ for when Jane\nfirst heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday, the very morning we were\nat Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it, she was quite decided against\naccepting the offer, and for the reasons you mention; exactly as you say, she\nhad made up her mind to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell’s\nreturn, and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at\npresent—and so she told Mrs. Elton over and over again—and I am\nsure I had no more idea that she would change her mind!—but that good\nMrs. Elton, whose judgment never fails her, saw farther than I did. It is not\nevery body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did, and refuse\nto take Jane’s answer; but she positively declared she would not\nwrite any such denial yesterday, as Jane wished her; she would wait—and,\nsure enough, yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go. Quite a\nsurprize to me! I had not the least idea!—Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and\ntold her at once, that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs.\nSmallridge’s situation, she had come to the resolution of accepting\nit.—I did not know a word of it till it was all settled.”',
			'“You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?”',
			'“Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come. It was settled so, upon\nthe hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley. ‘You\nmust all spend your evening with us,’ said\nshe—‘I positively must have you all come.’”',
			'“Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?”',
			'“No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though I\nthought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let him off,\nhe did not;—but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there, and a very\nagreeable evening we had. Such kind friends, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one must\nalways find agreeable, though every body seemed rather fagged after the\nmorning’s party. Even pleasure, you know, is fatiguing—and I cannot\nsay that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it. However, I\nshall always think it a very pleasant party, and feel extremely obliged to the\nkind friends who included me in it.”',
			'“Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been\nmaking up her mind the whole day?”',
			'“I dare say she had.”',
			'“Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all her\nfriends—but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is\npossible—I mean, as to the character and manners of the family.”',
			'“Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed, there is every thing in the\nworld that can make her happy in it. Except the Sucklings and Bragges, there is\nnot such another nursery establishment, so liberal and elegant, in all Mrs.\nElton’s acquaintance. Mrs. Smallridge, a most delightful woman!—A\nstyle of living almost equal to Maple Grove—and as to the children,\nexcept the little Sucklings and little Bragges, there are not such elegant\nsweet children anywhere. Jane will be treated with such regard and\nkindness!—It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of pleasure.—And\nher salary!—I really cannot venture to name her salary to you, Miss\nWoodhouse. Even you, used as you are to great sums, would hardly believe that\nso much could be given to a young person like Jane.”',
			'“Ah! madam,” cried Emma, “if other children are at all like\nwhat I remember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount of\nwhat I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions, dearly\nearned.”',
			'“You are so noble in your ideas!”',
			'“And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?”',
			'“Very soon, very soon, indeed; that’s the worst of it. Within a\nfortnight. Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry. My poor mother does not know\nhow to bear it. So then, I try to put it out of her thoughts, and say, Come\nma’am, do not let us think about it any more.”',
			'“Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel and Mrs.\nCampbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their\nreturn?”',
			'“Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such a situation\nas she cannot feel herself justified in declining. I was so astonished when she\nfirst told me what she had been saying to Mrs. Elton, and when Mrs. Elton at\nthe same moment came congratulating me upon it! It was before\ntea—stay—no, it could not be before tea, because we were just going\nto cards—and yet it was before tea, because I remember thinking—Oh!\nno, now I recollect, now I have it; something happened before tea, but not\nthat. Mr. Elton was called out of the room before tea, old John Abdy’s\nson wanted to speak with him. Poor old John, I have a great regard for him; he\nwas clerk to my poor father twenty-seven years; and now, poor old man, he is\nbed-ridden, and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints—I must\ngo and see him to-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she gets out at all. And\npoor John’s son came to talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish;\nhe is very well to do himself, you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler,\nand every thing of that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without some\nhelp; and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what John ostler had been\ntelling him, and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls\nto take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond. That was what happened before tea. It\nwas after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton.”',
			'Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this\ncircumstance was to her; but as without supposing it possible that she could be\nignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill’s going, she\nproceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence.',
			'What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the\naccumulation of the ostler’s own knowledge, and the knowledge of the\nservants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmond soon\nafter the return of the party from Box Hill—which messenger, however, had\nbeen no more than was expected; and that Mr. Churchill had sent his nephew a\nfew lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill,\nand only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early;\nbut that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly, without\nwaiting at all, and his horse seeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off\nimmediately for the Crown chaise, and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass\nby, the boy going a good pace, and driving very steady.',
			'There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and it caught\nEmma’s attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged\nher mind. The contrast between Mrs. Churchill’s importance in the world,\nand Jane Fairfax’s, struck her; one was every thing, the other\nnothing—and she sat musing on the difference of woman’s destiny,\nand quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed, till roused by Miss\nBates’s saying,',
			'“Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte. What is to become\nof that?—Very true. Poor dear Jane was talking of it just\nnow.—‘You must go,’ said she. ‘You and I must part. You\nwill have no business here.—Let it stay, however,’ said she;\n‘give it houseroom till Colonel Campbell comes back. I shall talk about\nit to him; he will settle for me; he will help me out of all my\ndifficulties.’—And to this day, I do believe, she knows not whether\nit was his present or his daughter’s.”',
			'Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance of all her\nformer fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing, that she soon\nallowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough; and, with a\nrepetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes\nwhich she really felt, took leave.',
		],
		[
			'Emma’s pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted; but\non entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her. Mr. Knightley and\nHarriet had arrived during her absence, and were sitting with her\nfather.—Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a manner decidedly\ngraver than usual, said,',
			'“I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare, and\ntherefore must now be gone directly. I am going to London, to spend a few days\nwith John and Isabella. Have you any thing to send or say, besides the\n‘love,’ which nobody carries?”',
			'“Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?”',
			'“Yes—rather—I have been thinking of it some little\ntime.”',
			'Emma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself. Time, however,\nshe thought, would tell him that they ought to be friends again. While he\nstood, as if meaning to go, but not going—her father began his inquiries.',
			'“Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?—And how did you find\nmy worthy old friend and her daughter?—I dare say they must have been\nvery much obliged to you for coming. Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs. and\nMiss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before. She is always so attentive to\nthem!”',
			'Emma’s colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a smile, and\nshake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr. Knightley.—It\nseemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour, as if his\neyes received the truth from hers, and all that had passed of good in her\nfeelings were at once caught and honoured.— He looked at her with a glow\nof regard. She was warmly gratified—and in another moment still more so,\nby a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part.—He\ntook her hand;—whether she had not herself made the first motion, she\ncould not say—she might, perhaps, have rather offered it—but he\ntook her hand, pressed it, and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his\nlips—when, from some fancy or other, he suddenly let it go.—Why he\nshould feel such a scruple, why he should change his mind when it was all but\ndone, she could not perceive.—He would have judged better, she thought,\nif he had not stopped.—The intention, however, was indubitable; and\nwhether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry, or however\nelse it happened, but she thought nothing became him more.—It was with\nhim, of so simple, yet so dignified a nature.—She could not but recall\nthe attempt with great satisfaction. It spoke such perfect amity.—He left\nthem immediately afterwards—gone in a moment. He always moved with the\nalertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory, but now he\nseemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance.',
			'Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wished she had\nleft her ten minutes earlier;—it would have been a great pleasure to talk\nover Jane Fairfax’s situation with Mr. Knightley.—Neither would she\nregret that he should be going to Brunswick Square, for she knew how much his\nvisit would be enjoyed—but it might have happened at a better\ntime—and to have had longer notice of it, would have been\npleasanter.—They parted thorough friends, however; she could not be\ndeceived as to the meaning of his countenance, and his unfinished\ngallantry;—it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his\ngood opinion.—He had been sitting with them half an hour, she found. It\nwas a pity that she had not come back earlier!',
			'In the hope of diverting her father’s thoughts from the disagreeableness\nof Mr. Knightley’s going to London; and going so suddenly; and going on\nhorseback, which she knew would be all very bad; Emma communicated her news of\nJane Fairfax, and her dependence on the effect was justified; it supplied a\nvery useful check,—interested, without disturbing him. He had long made\nup his mind to Jane Fairfax’s going out as governess, and could talk of\nit cheerfully, but Mr. Knightley’s going to London had been an unexpected\nblow.',
			'“I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so comfortably\nsettled. Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable, and I dare say her\nacquaintance are just what they ought to be. I hope it is a dry situation, and\nthat her health will be taken good care of. It ought to be a first object, as I\nam sure poor Miss Taylor’s always was with me. You know, my dear, she is\ngoing to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us. And I hope she will be\nbetter off in one respect, and not be induced to go away after it has been her\nhome so long.”',
			'The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else into the\nbackground. An express arrived at Randalls to announce the death of Mrs.\nChurchill! Though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her\naccount, she had not lived above six-and-thirty hours after his return. A\nsudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general\nstate, had carried her off after a short struggle. The great Mrs. Churchill was\nno more.',
			'It was felt as such things must be felt. Every body had a degree of gravity and\nsorrow; tenderness towards the departed, solicitude for the surviving friends;\nand, in a reasonable time, curiosity to know where she would be buried.\nGoldsmith tells us, that when lovely woman stoops to folly, she has nothing to\ndo but to die; and when she stoops to be disagreeable, it is equally to be\nrecommended as a clearer of ill-fame. Mrs. Churchill, after being disliked at\nleast twenty-five years, was now spoken of with compassionate allowances. In\none point she was fully justified. She had never been admitted before to be\nseriously ill. The event acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the\nselfishness of imaginary complaints.',
			'“Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal: more\nthan any body had ever supposed—and continual pain would try the temper.\nIt was a sad event—a great shock—with all her faults, what would\nMr. Churchill do without her? Mr. Churchill’s loss would be dreadful\nindeed. Mr. Churchill would never get over it.”—Even Mr. Weston\nshook his head, and looked solemn, and said, “Ah! poor woman, who would\nhave thought it!” and resolved, that his mourning should be as handsome\nas possible; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a\ncommiseration and good sense, true and steady. How it would affect Frank was\namong the earliest thoughts of both. It was also a very early speculation with\nEmma. The character of Mrs. Churchill, the grief of her husband—her mind\nglanced over them both with awe and compassion—and then rested with\nlightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event, how benefited,\nhow freed. She saw in a moment all the possible good. Now, an attachment to\nHarriet Smith would have nothing to encounter. Mr. Churchill, independent of\nhis wife, was feared by nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any\nthing by his nephew. All that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should\nform the attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the cause, Emma could feel no\ncertainty of its being already formed.',
			'Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great self-command. What\never she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed nothing. Emma was gratified,\nto observe such a proof in her of strengthened character, and refrained from\nany allusion that might endanger its maintenance. They spoke, therefore, of\nMrs. Churchill’s death with mutual forbearance.',
			'Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating all that was\nimmediately important of their state and plans. Mr. Churchill was better than\ncould be expected; and their first removal, on the departure of the funeral for\nYorkshire, was to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor, to whom Mr.\nChurchill had been promising a visit the last ten years. At present, there was\nnothing to be done for Harriet; good wishes for the future were all that could\nyet be possible on Emma’s side.',
			'It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax, whose\nprospects were closing, while Harriet’s opened, and whose engagements now\nallowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished to shew her\nkindness—and with Emma it was grown into a first wish. She had scarcely a\nstronger regret than for her past coldness; and the person, whom she had been\nso many months neglecting, was now the very one on whom she would have lavished\nevery distinction of regard or sympathy. She wanted to be of use to her; wanted\nto shew a value for her society, and testify respect and consideration. She\nresolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield. A note was written to\nurge it. The invitation was refused, and by a verbal message. “Miss\nFairfax was not well enough to write;” and when Mr. Perry called at\nHartfield, the same morning, it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to\nhave been visited, though against her own consent, by himself, and that she was\nsuffering under severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made\nhim doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge’s at the time\nproposed. Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged—appetite\nquite gone—and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms, nothing\ntouching the pulmonary complaint, which was the standing apprehension of the\nfamily, Mr. Perry was uneasy about her. He thought she had undertaken more than\nshe was equal to, and that she felt it so herself, though she would not own it.\nHer spirits seemed overcome. Her present home, he could not but observe, was\nunfavourable to a nervous disorder:—confined always to one room;—he\ncould have wished it otherwise—and her good aunt, though his very old\nfriend, he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that\ndescription. Her care and attention could not be questioned; they were, in\nfact, only too great. He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil\nthan good from them. Emma listened with the warmest concern; grieved for her\nmore and more, and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful. To\ntake her—be it only an hour or two—from her aunt, to give her\nchange of air and scene, and quiet rational conversation, even for an hour or\ntwo, might do her good; and the following morning she wrote again to say, in\nthe most feeling language she could command, that she would call for her in the\ncarriage at any hour that Jane would name—mentioning that she had Mr.\nPerry’s decided opinion, in favour of such exercise for his patient. The\nanswer was only in this short note:',
			'“Miss Fairfax’s compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to any\nexercise.”',
			'Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it was\nimpossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewed\nindisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she might best counteract\nthis unwillingness to be seen or assisted. In spite of the answer, therefore,\nshe ordered the carriage, and drove to Mrs. Bates’s, in the hope that\nJane would be induced to join her—but it would not do;—Miss Bates\ncame to the carriage door, all gratitude, and agreeing with her most earnestly\nin thinking an airing might be of the greatest service—and every thing\nthat message could do was tried—but all in vain. Miss Bates was obliged\nto return without success; Jane was quite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of\ngoing out seemed to make her worse.—Emma wished she could have seen her,\nand tried her own powers; but, almost before she could hint the wish, Miss\nBates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss\nWoodhouse in. “Indeed, the truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear\nto see any body—any body at all—Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be\ndenied—and Mrs. Cole had made such a point—and Mrs. Perry had said\nso much—but, except them, Jane would really see nobody.”',
			'Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys, and the\nMrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere; neither could she feel any\nright of preference herself—she submitted, therefore, and only questioned\nMiss Bates farther as to her niece’s appetite and diet, which she longed\nto be able to assist. On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy, and\nvery communicative; Jane would hardly eat any thing:—Mr. Perry\nrecommended nourishing food; but every thing they could command (and never had\nany body such good neighbours) was distasteful.',
			'Emma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an examination of\nher stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched\nto Miss Bates with a most friendly note. In half an hour the arrowroot was\nreturned, with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates, but “dear Jane would\nnot be satisfied without its being sent back; it was a thing she could not\ntake—and, moreover, she insisted on her saying, that she was not at all\nin want of any thing.”',
			'When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering about the\nmeadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon of the very day on\nwhich she had, under the plea of being unequal to any exercise, so peremptorily\nrefused to go out with her in the carriage, she could have no\ndoubt—putting every thing together—that Jane was resolved to\nreceive no kindness from her. She was sorry, very sorry. Her heart was\ngrieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of\nirritation of spirits, inconsistency of action, and inequality of powers; and\nit mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling, or\nesteemed so little worthy as a friend: but she had the consolation of knowing\nthat her intentions were good, and of being able to say to herself, that could\nMr. Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax,\ncould he even have seen into her heart, he would not, on this occasion, have\nfound any thing to reprove.',

		[
			'One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill’s decease, Emma was\ncalled downstairs to Mr. Weston, who “could not stay five minutes, and\nwanted particularly to speak with her.”—He met her at the\nparlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key of his\nvoice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,',
			'“Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?—Do, if it be\npossible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you.”',
			'“Is she unwell?”',
			'“No, no, not at all—only a little agitated. She would have ordered\nthe carriage, and come to you, but she must see you alone, and that you\nknow—(nodding towards her father)—Humph!—Can you come?”',
			'“Certainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to refuse what\nyou ask in such a way. But what can be the matter?—Is she really not\nill?”',
			'“Depend upon me—but ask no more questions. You will know it all in\ntime. The most unaccountable business! But hush, hush!”',
			'To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma. Something really\nimportant seemed announced by his looks; but, as her friend was well, she\nendeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling it with her father, that she would\ntake her walk now, she and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and\non their way at a quick pace for Randalls.',
			'“Now,”—said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep\ngates,—“now Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.”',
			'“No, no,”—he gravely replied.—“Don’t ask\nme. I promised my wife to leave it all to her. She will break it to you better\nthan I can. Do not be impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon.”',
			'“Break it to me,” cried Emma, standing still with\nterror.—“Good God!—Mr. Weston, tell me at\nonce.—Something has happened in Brunswick Square. I know it has. Tell me,\nI charge you tell me this moment what it is.”',
			'“No, indeed you are mistaken.”—',
			'“Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.—Consider how many of my dearest\nfriends are now in Brunswick Square. Which of them is it?—I charge you by\nall that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.”',
			'“Upon my word, Emma.”—',
			'“Your word!—why not your honour!—why not say upon your\nhonour, that it has nothing to do with any of them? Good Heavens!—What\ncan be to be broke to me, that does not relate to one of that\nfamily?”',
			'“Upon my honour,” said he very seriously, “it does not. It is\nnot in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of\nKnightley.”',
			'Emma’s courage returned, and she walked on.',
			'“I was wrong,” he continued, “in talking of its being\nbroke to you. I should not have used the expression. In fact, it does\nnot concern you—it concerns only myself,—that is, we\nhope.—Humph!—In short, my dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so\nuneasy about it. I don’t say that it is not a disagreeable\nbusiness—but things might be much worse.—If we walk fast, we shall\nsoon be at Randalls.”',
			'Emma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort. She asked no\nmore questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy, and that soon pointed\nout to her the probability of its being some money concern—something just\ncome to light, of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the\nfamily,—something which the late event at Richmond had brought forward.\nHer fancy was very active. Half a dozen natural children, perhaps—and\npoor Frank cut off!—This, though very undesirable, would be no matter of\nagony to her. It inspired little more than an animating curiosity.',
			'“Who is that gentleman on horseback?” said she, as they\nproceeded—speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret, than\nwith any other view.',
			'“I do not know.—One of the Otways.—Not Frank;—it is not\nFrank, I assure you. You will not see him. He is half way to Windsor by this\ntime.”',
			'“Has your son been with you, then?”',
			'“Oh! yes—did not you know?—Well, well, never mind.”',
			'For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded and\ndemure,',
			'“Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.”',
			'They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.—“Well, my\ndear,” said he, as they entered the room—“I have brought her,\nand now I hope you will soon be better. I shall leave you together. There is no\nuse in delay. I shall not be far off, if you want me.”—And Emma\ndistinctly heard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the\nroom,—“I have been as good as my word. She has not the least\nidea.”',
			'Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation, that\nEmma’s uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone, she eagerly\nsaid,',
			'“What is it my dear friend? Something of a very unpleasant nature, I\nfind, has occurred;—do let me know directly what it is. I have been\nwalking all this way in complete suspense. We both abhor suspense. Do not let\nmine continue longer. It will do you good to speak of your distress, whatever\nit may be.”',
			'“Have you indeed no idea?” said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice.\n“Cannot you, my dear Emma—cannot you form a guess as to what you\nare to hear?”',
			'“So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess.”',
			'“You are right. It does relate to him, and I will tell you\ndirectly;” (resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.)\n“He has been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand. It\nis impossible to express our surprize. He came to speak to his father on a\nsubject,—to announce an attachment—”',
			'She stopped to breathe. Emma thought first of herself, and then of Harriet.',
			'“More than an attachment, indeed,” resumed Mrs. Weston; “an\nengagement—a positive engagement.—What will you say,\nEmma—what will any body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and\nMiss Fairfax are engaged;—nay, that they have been long engaged!”',
			'Emma even jumped with surprize;—and, horror-struck, exclaimed,',
			'“Jane Fairfax!—Good God! You are not serious? You do not mean\nit?”',
			'“You may well be amazed,” returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her\neyes, and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to\nrecover— “You may well be amazed. But it is even so. There has been\na solemn engagement between them ever since October—formed at Weymouth,\nand kept a secret from every body. Not a creature knowing it but\nthemselves—neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.—It is so\nwonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yet almost\nincredible to myself. I can hardly believe it.—I thought I knew\nhim.”',
			'Emma scarcely heard what was said.—Her mind was divided between two\nideas—her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax; and poor\nHarriet;—and for some time she could only exclaim, and require\nconfirmation, repeated confirmation.',
			'“Well,” said she at last, trying to recover herself; “this is\na circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can at all\ncomprehend it. What!—engaged to her all the winter—before either of\nthem came to Highbury?”',
			'“Engaged since October,—secretly engaged.—It has hurt me,\nEmma, very much. It has hurt his father equally. Some part of his\nconduct we cannot excuse.”',
			'Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, “I will not pretend not\nto understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured that\nno such effect has followed his attentions to me, as you are apprehensive\nof.”',
			'Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma’s countenance was as\nsteady as her words.',
			'“That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my present\nperfect indifference,” she continued, “I will farther tell you,\nthat there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when I did like\nhim, when I was very much disposed to be attached to him—nay, was\nattached—and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder. Fortunately,\nhowever, it did cease. I have really for some time past, for at least these\nthree months, cared nothing about him. You may believe me, Mrs. Weston. This is\nthe simple truth.”',
			'Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could find utterance,\nassured her, that this protestation had done her more good than any thing else\nin the world could do.',
			'“Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,” said she.\n“On this point we have been wretched. It was our darling wish that you\nmight be attached to each other—and we were persuaded that it was\nso.— Imagine what we have been feeling on your account.”',
			'“I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of grateful\nwonder to you and myself. But this does not acquit him, Mrs. Weston; and\nI must say, that I think him greatly to blame. What right had he to come among\nus with affection and faith engaged, and with manners so very\ndisengaged? What right had he to endeavour to please, as he certainly\ndid—to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention, as he\ncertainly did—while he really belonged to another?—How could he\ntell what mischief he might be doing?—How could he tell that he might not\nbe making me in love with him?—very wrong, very wrong indeed.”',
			'“From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather\nimagine—”',
			'“And how could she bear such behaviour! Composure with a witness!\nto look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman, before\nher face, and not resent it.—That is a degree of placidity, which I can\nneither comprehend nor respect.”',
			'“There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said so expressly.\nHe had not time to enter into much explanation. He was here only a quarter of\nan hour, and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of\nthe time he could stay—but that there had been misunderstandings he\ndecidedly said. The present crisis, indeed, seemed to be brought on by them;\nand those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of\nhis conduct.”',
			'“Impropriety! Oh! Mrs. Weston—it is too calm a censure. Much, much\nbeyond impropriety!—It has sunk him, I cannot say how it has sunk him in\nmy opinion. So unlike what a man should be!—None of that upright\nintegrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that disdain of trick\nand littleness, which a man should display in every transaction of his\nlife.”',
			'“Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been wrong\nin this instance, I have known him long enough to answer for his having many,\nvery many, good qualities; and—”',
			'“Good God!” cried Emma, not attending to her.—“Mrs.\nSmallridge, too! Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could\nhe mean by such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself—to\nsuffer her even to think of such a measure!”',
			'“He knew nothing about it, Emma. On this article I can fully acquit him.\nIt was a private resolution of hers, not communicated to him—or at least\nnot communicated in a way to carry conviction.—Till yesterday, I know he\nsaid he was in the dark as to her plans. They burst on him, I do not know how,\nbut by some letter or message—and it was the discovery of what she was\ndoing, of this very project of hers, which determined him to come forward at\nonce, own it all to his uncle, throw himself on his kindness, and, in short,\nput an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so\nlong.”',
			'Emma began to listen better.',
			'“I am to hear from him soon,” continued Mrs. Weston. “He told\nme at parting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which seemed\nto promise me many particulars that could not be given now. Let us wait,\ntherefore, for this letter. It may bring many extenuations. It may make many\nthings intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood.\nDon’t let us be severe, don’t let us be in a hurry to condemn him.\nLet us have patience. I must love him; and now that I am satisfied on one\npoint, the one material point, I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out\nwell, and ready to hope that it may. They must both have suffered a great deal\nunder such a system of secresy and concealment.”',
			'“His sufferings,” replied Emma dryly, “do not appear\nto have done him much harm. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?”',
			'“Most favourably for his nephew—gave his consent with scarcely a\ndifficulty. Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family! While\npoor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not have been a hope, a\nchance, a possibility;—but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family\nvault, than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would\nhave required. What a blessing it is, when undue influence does not survive the\ngrave!—He gave his consent with very little persuasion.”',
			'“Ah!” thought Emma, “he would have done as much for\nHarriet.”',
			'“This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light this\nmorning. He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates’s, I fancy, some\ntime—and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his\nuncle, to whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I tell you, he\ncould stay with us but a quarter of an hour.—He was very much\nagitated—very much, indeed—to a degree that made him appear quite a\ndifferent creature from any thing I had ever seen him before.—In addition\nto all the rest, there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell, which\nhe had had no previous suspicion of—and there was every appearance of his\nhaving been feeling a great deal.”',
			'“And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such\nperfect secresy?—The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know of the\nengagement?”',
			'Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.',
			'“None; not one. He positively said that it had been known to no being in\nthe world but their two selves.”',
			'“Well,” said Emma, “I suppose we shall gradually grow\nreconciled to the idea, and I wish them very happy. But I shall always think it\na very abominable sort of proceeding. What has it been but a system of\nhypocrisy and deceit,—espionage, and treachery?—To come among us\nwith professions of openness and simplicity; and such a league in secret to\njudge us all!—Here have we been, the whole winter and spring, completely\nduped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour, with two\npeople in the midst of us who may have been carrying round, comparing and\nsitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to\nhear.—They must take the consequence, if they have heard each other\nspoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable!”',
			'“I am quite easy on that head,” replied Mrs. Weston. “I am\nvery sure that I never said any thing of either to the other, which both might\nnot have heard.”',
			'“You are in luck.—Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when\nyou imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.”',
			'“True. But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss\nFairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her; and as to\nspeaking ill of him, there I must have been safe.”',
			'At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window,\nevidently on the watch. His wife gave him a look which invited him in; and,\nwhile he was coming round, added, “Now, dearest Emma, let me intreat you\nto say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease, and incline him to\nbe satisfied with the match. Let us make the best of it—and, indeed,\nalmost every thing may be fairly said in her favour. It is not a connexion to\ngratify; but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that, why should we? and it may be\na very fortunate circumstance for him, for Frank, I mean, that he should have\nattached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as\nI have always given her credit for—and still am disposed to give her\ncredit for, in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right.\nAnd how much may be said in her situation for even that error!”',
			'“Much, indeed!” cried Emma feelingly. “If a woman can ever be\nexcused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like Jane\nFairfax’s.—Of such, one may almost say, that ‘the world is\nnot their’s, nor the world’s law.’”',
			'She met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance, exclaiming,',
			'“A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! This was a\ndevice, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise my talent of\nguessing. But you really frightened me. I thought you had lost half your\nproperty, at least. And here, instead of its being a matter of condolence, it\nturns out to be one of congratulation.—I congratulate you, Mr. Weston,\nwith all my heart, on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and\naccomplished young women in England for your daughter.”',
			'A glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was as right\nas this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate.\nHis air and voice recovered their usual briskness: he shook her heartily and\ngratefully by the hand, and entered on the subject in a manner to prove, that\nhe now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad\nthing. His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence, or smooth\nobjections; and by the time they had talked it all over together, and he had\ntalked it all over again with Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he was\nbecome perfectly reconciled, and not far from thinking it the very best thing\nthat Frank could possibly have done.',
		],
		[
			'“Harriet, poor Harriet!”—Those were the words; in them lay\nthe tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted the\nreal misery of the business to her. Frank Churchill had behaved very ill by\nherself—very ill in many ways,—but it was not so much his\nbehaviour as her own, which made her so angry with him. It was the\nscrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet’s account, that gave the\ndeepest hue to his offence.—Poor Harriet! to be a second time the dupe of\nher misconceptions and flattery. Mr. Knightley had spoken prophetically, when\nhe once said, “Emma, you have been no friend to Harriet\nSmith.”—She was afraid she had done her nothing but\ndisservice.—It was true that she had not to charge herself, in this\ninstance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of the\nmischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have\nentered Harriet’s imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged her\nadmiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a\nhint on the subject; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what\nshe might have repressed. She might have prevented the indulgence and increase\nof such sentiments. Her influence would have been enough. And now she was very\nconscious that she ought to have prevented them.—She felt that she had\nbeen risking her friend’s happiness on most insufficient grounds. Common\nsense would have directed her to tell Harriet, that she must not allow herself\nto think of him, and that there were five hundred chances to one against his\never caring for her.—“But, with common sense,” she added,\n“I am afraid I have had little to do.”',
			'She was extremely angry with herself. If she could not have been angry with\nFrank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.—As for Jane Fairfax,\nshe might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her\naccount. Harriet would be anxiety enough; she need no longer be unhappy about\nJane, whose troubles and whose ill-health having, of course, the same origin,\nmust be equally under cure.—Her days of insignificance and evil were\nover.—She would soon be well, and happy, and prosperous.—Emma could\nnow imagine why her own attentions had been slighted. This discovery laid many\nsmaller matters open. No doubt it had been from jealousy.—In Jane’s\neyes she had been a rival; and well might any thing she could offer of\nassistance or regard be repulsed. An airing in the Hartfield carriage would\nhave been the rack, and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been\npoison. She understood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself\nfrom the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged that\nJane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert. But\npoor Harriet was such an engrossing charge! There was little sympathy to be\nspared for any body else. Emma was sadly fearful that this second\ndisappointment would be more severe than the first. Considering the very\nsuperior claims of the object, it ought; and judging by its apparently stronger\neffect on Harriet’s mind, producing reserve and self-command, it\nwould.—She must communicate the painful truth, however, and as soon as\npossible. An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston’s parting\nwords. “For the present, the whole affair was to be completely a secret.\nMr. Churchill had made a point of it, as a token of respect to the wife he had\nso very recently lost; and every body admitted it to be no more than due\ndecorum.”—Emma had promised; but still Harriet must be excepted. It\nwas her superior duty.',
			'In spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous, that\nshe should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by\nHarriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by herself. The intelligence,\nwhich had been so anxiously announced to her, she was now to be anxiously\nannouncing to another. Her heart beat quick on hearing Harriet’s footstep\nand voice; so, she supposed, had poor Mrs. Weston felt when she was\napproaching Randalls. Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal\nresemblance!—But of that, unfortunately, there could be no chance.',
			'“Well, Miss Woodhouse!” cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the\nroom—“is not this the oddest news that ever was?”',
			'“What news do you mean?” replied Emma, unable to guess, by look or\nvoice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.',
			'“About Jane Fairfax. Did you ever hear any thing so strange?\nOh!—you need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has told me\nhimself. I met him just now. He told me it was to be a great secret; and,\ntherefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you, but he said\nyou knew it.”',
			'“What did Mr. Weston tell you?”—said Emma, still perplexed.',
			'“Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill\nare to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one another\nthis long while. How very odd!”',
			'It was, indeed, so odd; Harriet’s behaviour was so extremely odd, that\nEmma did not know how to understand it. Her character appeared absolutely\nchanged. She seemed to propose shewing no agitation, or disappointment, or\npeculiar concern in the discovery. Emma looked at her, quite unable to speak.',
			'“Had you any idea,” cried Harriet, “of his being in love with\nher?—You, perhaps, might.—You (blushing as she spoke) who can see\ninto every body’s heart; but nobody else—”',
			'“Upon my word,” said Emma, “I begin to doubt my having any\nsuch talent. Can you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached\nto another woman at the very time that I was—tacitly, if not\nopenly—encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?—I never\nhad the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank\nChurchill’s having the least regard for Jane Fairfax. You may be very\nsure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly.”',
			'“Me!” cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished. “Why should\nyou caution me?—You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.”',
			'“I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,”\nreplied Emma, smiling; “but you do not mean to deny that there was a\ntime—and not very distant either—when you gave me reason to\nunderstand that you did care about him?”',
			'“Him!—never, never. Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake\nme?” turning away distressed.',
			'“Harriet!” cried Emma, after a moment’s\npause—“What do you mean?—Good Heaven! what do you\nmean?—Mistake you!—Am I to suppose then?—”',
			'She could not speak another word.—Her voice was lost; and she sat down,\nwaiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.',
			'Harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned from her, did\nnot immediately say any thing; and when she did speak, it was in a voice nearly\nas agitated as Emma’s.',
			'“I should not have thought it possible,” she began, “that you\ncould have misunderstood me! I know we agreed never to name him—but\nconsidering how infinitely superior he is to every body else, I should not have\nthought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person. Mr.\nFrank Churchill, indeed! I do not know who would ever look at him in the\ncompany of the other. I hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr. Frank\nChurchill, who is like nobody by his side. And that you should have been so\nmistaken, is amazing!—I am sure, but for believing that you entirely\napproved and meant to encourage me in my attachment, I should have considered\nit at first too great a presumption almost, to dare to think of him. At first,\nif you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened; that there had\nbeen matches of greater disparity (those were your very words);—I should\nnot have dared to give way to—I should not have thought it\npossible—But if you, who had been always acquainted with\nhim—”',
			'“Harriet!” cried Emma, collecting herself\nresolutely—“Let us understand each other now, without the\npossibility of farther mistake. Are you speaking of—Mr. Knightley?”',
			'“To be sure I am. I never could have an idea of any body else—and\nso I thought you knew. When we talked about him, it was as clear as\npossible.”',
			'“Not quite,” returned Emma, with forced calmness, “for all\nthat you then said, appeared to me to relate to a different person. I could\nalmost assert that you had named Mr. Frank Churchill. I am sure the\nservice Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in protecting you from the\ngipsies, was spoken of.”',
			'“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!”',
			'“My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on\nthe occasion. I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment; that\nconsidering the service he had rendered you, it was extremely\nnatural:—and you agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as to your\nsense of that service, and mentioning even what your sensations had been in\nseeing him come forward to your rescue.—The impression of it is strong on\nmy memory.”',
			'“Oh, dear,” cried Harriet, “now I recollect what you mean;\nbut I was thinking of something very different at the time. It was not the\ngipsies—it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant. No! (with some\nelevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance—of Mr.\nKnightley’s coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton would not stand\nup with me; and when there was no other partner in the room. That was the kind\naction; that was the noble benevolence and generosity; that was the service\nwhich made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon\nearth.”',
			'“Good God!” cried Emma, “this has been a most\nunfortunate—most deplorable mistake!—What is to be done?”',
			'“You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me? At\nleast, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if the other had\nbeen the person; and now—it is possible—”',
			'She paused a few moments. Emma could not speak.',
			'“I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,” she resumed, “that you\nshould feel a great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body. You\nmust think one five hundred million times more above me than the other. But I\nhope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing—that if—strange as it may\nappear—. But you know they were your own words, that more\nwonderful things had happened, matches of greater disparity had taken\nplace than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if\nsuch a thing even as this, may have occurred before—and if I should be so\nfortunate, beyond expression, as to—if Mr. Knightley should\nreally—if he does not mind the disparity, I hope, dear Miss\nWoodhouse, you will not set yourself against it, and try to put difficulties in\nthe way. But you are too good for that, I am sure.”',
			'Harriet was standing at one of the windows. Emma turned round to look at her in\nconsternation, and hastily said,',
			'“Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley’s returning your\naffection?”',
			'“Yes,” replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully—“I\nmust say that I have.”',
			'Emma’s eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating, in\na fixed attitude, for a few minutes. A few minutes were sufficient for making\nher acquainted with her own heart. A mind like hers, once opening to suspicion,\nmade rapid progress. She touched—she admitted—she acknowledged the\nwhole truth. Why was it so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr.\nKnightley, than with Frank Churchill? Why was the evil so dreadfully increased\nby Harriet’s having some hope of a return? It darted through her, with\nthe speed of an arrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but herself!',
			'Her own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the same few\nminutes. She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before.\nHow improperly had she been acting by Harriet! How inconsiderate, how\nindelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling had been her conduct! What blindness,\nwhat madness, had led her on! It struck her with dreadful force, and she was\nready to give it every bad name in the world. Some portion of respect for\nherself, however, in spite of all these demerits—some concern for her own\nappearance, and a strong sense of justice by Harriet—(there would be no\nneed of compassion to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr.\nKnightley—but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any\ncoldness now,) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with\ncalmness, with even apparent kindness.—For her own advantage indeed, it\nwas fit that the utmost extent of Harriet’s hopes should be enquired\ninto; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had\nbeen so voluntarily formed and maintained—or to deserve to be slighted by\nthe person, whose counsels had never led her right.—Rousing from\nreflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion, she turned to Harriet again,\nand, in a more inviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as to the subject\nwhich had first introduced it, the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was\nquite sunk and lost.—Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and\nthemselves.',
			'Harriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad to be\ncalled from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge, and such a\nfriend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, to give the history of\nher hopes with great, though trembling delight.—Emma’s tremblings\nas she asked, and as she listened, were better concealed than Harriet’s,\nbut they were not less. Her voice was not unsteady; but her mind was in all the\nperturbation that such a development of self, such a burst of threatening evil,\nsuch a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions, must create.—She\nlistened with much inward suffering, but with great outward patience, to\nHarriet’s detail.—Methodical, or well arranged, or very well\ndelivered, it could not be expected to be; but it contained, when separated\nfrom all the feebleness and tautology of the narration, a substance to sink her\nspirit—especially with the corroborating circumstances, which her own\nmemory brought in favour of Mr. Knightley’s most improved opinion of\nHarriet.',
			'Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those\ntwo decisive dances.—Emma knew that he had, on that occasion, found her\nmuch superior to his expectation. From that evening, or at least from the time\nof Miss Woodhouse’s encouraging her to think of him, Harriet had begun to\nbe sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do, and of\nhis having indeed quite a different manner towards her; a manner of kindness\nand sweetness!—Latterly she had been more and more aware of it. When they\nhad been all walking together, he had so often come and walked by her, and\ntalked so very delightfully!—He seemed to want to be acquainted with her.\nEmma knew it to have been very much the case. She had often observed the\nchange, to almost the same extent.—Harriet repeated expressions of\napprobation and praise from him—and Emma felt them to be in the closest\nagreement with what she had known of his opinion of Harriet. He praised her for\nbeing without art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous,\nfeelings.—She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he had\ndwelt on them to her more than once.—Much that lived in Harriet’s\nmemory, many little particulars of the notice she had received from him, a\nlook, a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment implied, a\npreference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected, by Emma.\nCircumstances that might swell to half an hour’s relation, and contained\nmultiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had passed undiscerned by her who\nnow heard them; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned, the two of\nstrongest promise to Harriet, were not without some degree of witness from Emma\nherself.—The first, was his walking with her apart from the others, in\nthe lime-walk at Donwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma\ncame, and he had taken pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from the rest\nto himself—and at first, he had talked to her in a more particular way\nthan he had ever done before, in a very particular way indeed!—(Harriet\ncould not recall it without a blush.) He seemed to be almost asking her,\nwhether her affections were engaged.—But as soon as she (Miss Woodhouse)\nappeared likely to join them, he changed the subject, and began talking about\nfarming:—The second, was his having sat talking with her nearly half an\nhour before Emma came back from her visit, the very last morning of his being\nat Hartfield—though, when he first came in, he had said that he could not\nstay five minutes—and his having told her, during their conversation,\nthat though he must go to London, it was very much against his inclination that\nhe left home at all, which was much more (as Emma felt) than he had\nacknowledged to her. The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet,\nwhich this one article marked, gave her severe pain.',
			'On the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did, after a little\nreflection, venture the following question. “Might he not?—Is not\nit possible, that when enquiring, as you thought, into the state of your\naffections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin—he might have Mr.\nMartin’s interest in view? But Harriet rejected the suspicion with\nspirit.',
			'“Mr. Martin! No indeed!—There was not a hint of Mr. Martin. I hope\nI know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be suspected of\nit.”',
			'When Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear Miss Woodhouse,\nto say whether she had not good ground for hope.',
			'“I never should have presumed to think of it at first,” said she,\n“but for you. You told me to observe him carefully, and let his behaviour\nbe the rule of mine—and so I have. But now I seem to feel that I may\ndeserve him; and that if he does chuse me, it will not be any thing so very\nwonderful.”',
			'The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter feelings, made\nthe utmost exertion necessary on Emma’s side, to enable her to say on\nreply,',
			'“Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is the last\nman in the world, who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his\nfeeling for her more than he really does.”',
			'Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory; and\nEmma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which at that moment would have\nbeen dreadful penance, by the sound of her father’s footsteps. He was\ncoming through the hall. Harriet was too much agitated to encounter him.\n“She could not compose herself— Mr. Woodhouse would be\nalarmed—she had better go;”—with most ready encouragement\nfrom her friend, therefore, she passed off through another door—and the\nmoment she was gone, this was the spontaneous burst of Emma’s feelings:\n“Oh God! that I had never seen her!”',
			'The rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough for her\nthoughts.—She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed\non her within the last few hours. Every moment had brought a fresh surprize;\nand every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her.—How to\nunderstand it all! How to understand the deceptions she had been thus\npractising on herself, and living under!—The blunders, the blindness of\nher own head and heart!—she sat still, she walked about, she tried her\nown room, she tried the shrubbery—in every place, every posture, she\nperceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had been imposed on by\nothers in a most mortifying degree; that she had been imposing on herself in a\ndegree yet more mortifying; that she was wretched, and should probably find\nthis day but the beginning of wretchedness.',
			'To understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the first endeavour. To\nthat point went every leisure moment which her father’s claims on her\nallowed, and every moment of involuntary absence of mind.',
			'How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling declared him\nnow to be? When had his influence, such influence begun?— When had he\nsucceeded to that place in her affection, which Frank Churchill had once, for a\nshort period, occupied?—She looked back; she compared the\ntwo—compared them, as they had always stood in her estimation, from the\ntime of the latter’s becoming known to her—and as they must at any\ntime have been compared by her, had it—oh! had it, by any blessed\nfelicity, occurred to her, to institute the comparison.—She saw that\nthere never had been a time when she did not consider Mr. Knightley as\ninfinitely the superior, or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the\nmost dear. She saw, that in persuading herself, in fancying, in acting to the\ncontrary, she had been entirely under a delusion, totally ignorant of her own\nheart—and, in short, that she had never really cared for Frank Churchill\nat all!',
			'This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection. This was the\nknowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry, which she reached; and\nwithout being long in reaching it.—She was most sorrowfully indignant;\nashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her—her affection for\nMr. Knightley.—Every other part of her mind was disgusting.',
			'With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every\nbody’s feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every\nbody’s destiny. She was proved to have been universally mistaken; and she\nhad not quite done nothing—for she had done mischief. She had brought\nevil on Harriet, on herself, and she too much feared, on Mr.\nKnightley.—Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place, on her\nmust rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning; for his attachment,\nshe must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of\nHarriet’s;—and even were this not the case, he would never have\nknown Harriet at all but for her folly.',
			'Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!—It was a union to distance every wonder\nof the kind.—The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax became\ncommonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison, exciting no surprize,\npresenting no disparity, affording nothing to be said or thought.—Mr.\nKnightley and Harriet Smith!—Such an elevation on her side! Such a\ndebasement on his! It was horrible to Emma to think how it must sink him in the\ngeneral opinion, to foresee the smiles, the sneers, the merriment it would\nprompt at his expense; the mortification and disdain of his brother, the\nthousand inconveniences to himself.—Could it be?—No; it was\nimpossible. And yet it was far, very far, from impossible.—Was it a new\ncircumstance for a man of first-rate abilities to be captivated by very\ninferior powers? Was it new for one, perhaps too busy to seek, to be the prize\nof a girl who would seek him?—Was it new for any thing in this world to\nbe unequal, inconsistent, incongruous—or for chance and circumstance (as\nsecond causes) to direct the human fate?',
			'Oh! had she never brought Harriet forward! Had she left her where she ought,\nand where he had told her she ought!—Had she not, with a folly which no\ntongue could express, prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who\nwould have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she\nought to belong—all would have been safe; none of this dreadful sequel\nwould have been.',
			'How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to Mr.\nKnightley!—How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man\ntill actually assured of it!—But Harriet was less humble, had fewer\nscruples than formerly.—Her inferiority, whether of mind or situation,\nseemed little felt.—She had seemed more sensible of Mr. Elton’s\nbeing to stoop in marrying her, than she now seemed of Mr.\nKnightley’s.—Alas! was not that her own doing too? Who had been at\npains to give Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?—Who but\nherself had taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible, and that\nher claims were great to a high worldly establishment?—If Harriet, from\nbeing humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too.',
		],
		[
			'Till now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known how much\nof her happiness depended on being first with Mr. Knightley, first in\ninterest and affection.—Satisfied that it was so, and feeling it her due,\nshe had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the dread of being\nsupplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had been.—Long, very\nlong, she felt she had been first; for, having no female connexions of his own,\nthere had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers, and she\nhad always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella. She had\nherself been first with him for many years past. She had not deserved it; she\nhad often been negligent or perverse, slighting his advice, or even wilfully\nopposing him, insensible of half his merits, and quarrelling with him because\nhe would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own—but\nstill, from family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of mind, he\nhad loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an endeavour to improve\nher, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no other creature had at all\nshared. In spite of all her faults, she knew she was dear to him; might she not\nsay, very dear?—When the suggestions of hope, however, which must follow\nhere, presented themselves, she could not presume to indulge them. Harriet\nSmith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly, exclusively,\npassionately loved by Mr. Knightley. She could not. She could not\nflatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to her. She\nhad received a very recent proof of its impartiality.—How shocked had he\nbeen by her behaviour to Miss Bates! How directly, how strongly had he\nexpressed himself to her on the subject!—Not too strongly for the\noffence—but far, far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than\nupright justice and clear-sighted goodwill.—She had no hope, nothing to\ndeserve the name of hope, that he could have that sort of affection for herself\nwhich was now in question; but there was a hope (at times a slight one, at\ntimes much stronger,) that Harriet might have deceived herself, and be\noverrating his regard for her.—Wish it she must, for his\nsake—be the consequence nothing to herself, but his remaining single all\nhis life. Could she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at all,\nshe believed she should be perfectly satisfied.—Let him but continue the\nsame Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr. Knightley to all the\nworld; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of\nfriendship and confidence, and her peace would be fully\nsecured.—Marriage, in fact, would not do for her. It would be\nincompatible with what she owed to her father, and with what she felt for him.\nNothing should separate her from her father. She would not marry, even if she\nwere asked by Mr. Knightley.',
			'It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; and she hoped,\nthat when able to see them together again, she might at least be able to\nascertain what the chances for it were.—She should see them henceforward\nwith the closest observance; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood\neven those she was watching, she did not know how to admit that she could be\nblinded here.—He was expected back every day. The power of observation\nwould be soon given—frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were\nin one course. In the meanwhile, she resolved against seeing Harriet.—It\nwould do neither of them good, it would do the subject no good, to be talking\nof it farther.—She was resolved not to be convinced, as long as she could\ndoubt, and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet’s confidence. To\ntalk would be only to irritate.—She wrote to her, therefore, kindly, but\ndecisively, to beg that she would not, at present, come to Hartfield;\nacknowledging it to be her conviction, that all farther confidential discussion\nof one topic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were\nallowed to pass before they met again, except in the company of\nothers—she objected only to a tête-à-tête—they might be able to act\nas if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.—Harriet\nsubmitted, and approved, and was grateful.',
			'This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma’s\nthoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them, sleeping or\nwaking, the last twenty-four hours—Mrs. Weston, who had been calling on\nher daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her way home, almost as much\nin duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself, to relate all the particulars of so\ninteresting an interview.',
			'Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates’s, and gone through his\nshare of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having then induced\nMiss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned with much more to say,\nand much more to say with satisfaction, than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs.\nBates’s parlour, with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings, could have\nafforded.',
			'A little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while her friend\nrelated. Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation\nherself; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present, to be\nallowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead, and to defer this ceremonious\ncall till a little time had passed, and Mr. Churchill could be reconciled to\nthe engagement’s becoming known; as, considering every thing, she thought\nsuch a visit could not be paid without leading to reports:—but Mr. Weston\nhad thought differently; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to\nMiss Fairfax and her family, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be\nexcited by it; or if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for\n“such things,” he observed, “always got about.” Emma\nsmiled, and felt that Mr. Weston had very good reason for saying so. They had\ngone, in short—and very great had been the evident distress and confusion\nof the lady. She had hardly been able to speak a word, and every look and\naction had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness. The quiet,\nheart-felt satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight of her\ndaughter—who proved even too joyous to talk as usual, had been a\ngratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene. They were both so truly respectable\nin their happiness, so disinterested in every sensation; thought so much of\nJane; so much of every body, and so little of themselves, that every kindly\nfeeling was at work for them. Miss Fairfax’s recent illness had offered a\nfair plea for Mrs. Weston to invite her to an airing; she had drawn back and\ndeclined at first, but, on being pressed had yielded; and, in the course of\ntheir drive, Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of her\nembarrassment, as to bring her to converse on the important subject. Apologies\nfor her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception, and the warmest\nexpressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr.\nWeston, must necessarily open the cause; but when these effusions were put by,\nthey had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the\nengagement. Mrs. Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the\ngreatest relief to her companion, pent up within her own mind as every thing\nhad so long been, and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the\nsubject.',
			'“On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment of so\nmany months,” continued Mrs. Weston, “she was energetic. This was\none of her expressions. ‘I will not say, that since I entered into the\nengagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that I have never\nknown the blessing of one tranquil hour:’—and the quivering lip,\nEmma, which uttered it, was an attestation that I felt at my heart.”',
			'“Poor girl!” said Emma. “She thinks herself wrong, then, for\nhaving consented to a private engagement?”',
			'“Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed to\nblame herself. ‘The consequence,’ said she, ‘has been a state\nof perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought. But after all the punishment\nthat misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct. Pain is no\nexpiation. I never can be blameless. I have been acting contrary to all my\nsense of right; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken, and the\nkindness I am now receiving, is what my conscience tells me ought not to\nbe.’ ‘Do not imagine, madam,’ she continued, ‘that I\nwas taught wrong. Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care\nof the friends who brought me up. The error has been all my own; and I do\nassure you that, with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to\ngive, I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel\nCampbell.’”',
			'“Poor girl!” said Emma again. “She loves him then\nexcessively, I suppose. It must have been from attachment only, that she could\nbe led to form the engagement. Her affection must have overpowered her\njudgment.”',
			'“Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him.”',
			'“I am afraid,” returned Emma, sighing, “that I must often\nhave contributed to make her unhappy.”',
			'“On your side, my love, it was very innocently done. But she probably had\nsomething of that in her thoughts, when alluding to the misunderstandings which\nhe had given us hints of before. One natural consequence of the evil she had\ninvolved herself in,” she said, “was that of making her\nunreasonable. The consciousness of having done amiss, had exposed her to\na thousand inquietudes, and made her captious and irritable to a degree that\nmust have been—that had been—hard for him to bear. ‘I did not\nmake the allowances,’ said she, ‘which I ought to have done, for\nhis temper and spirits—his delightful spirits, and that gaiety, that\nplayfulness of disposition, which, under any other circumstances, would, I am\nsure, have been as constantly bewitching to me, as they were at first.’\nShe then began to speak of you, and of the great kindness you had shewn her\nduring her illness; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected,\ndesired me, whenever I had an opportunity, to thank you—I could not thank\nyou too much—for every wish and every endeavour to do her good. She was\nsensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from\nherself.”',
			'“If I did not know her to be happy now,” said Emma, seriously,\n“which, in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience,\nshe must be, I could not bear these thanks;—for, oh! Mrs. Weston, if\nthere were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss\nFairfax!—Well (checking herself, and trying to be more lively), this is\nall to be forgotten. You are very kind to bring me these interesting\nparticulars. They shew her to the greatest advantage. I am sure she is very\ngood—I hope she will be very happy. It is fit that the fortune should be\non his side, for I think the merit will be all on hers.”',
			'Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston. She thought well of\nFrank in almost every respect; and, what was more, she loved him very much, and\nher defence was, therefore, earnest. She talked with a great deal of reason,\nand at least equal affection—but she had too much to urge for\nEmma’s attention; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell; she\nforgot to attempt to listen; and when Mrs. Weston ended with, “We have\nnot yet had the letter we are so anxious for, you know, but I hope it will soon\ncome,” she was obliged to pause before she answered, and at last obliged\nto answer at random, before she could at all recollect what letter it was which\nthey were so anxious for.',
			'“Are you well, my Emma?” was Mrs. Weston’s parting question.',
			'“Oh! perfectly. I am always well, you know. Be sure to give me\nintelligence of the letter as soon as possible.”',
			'Mrs. Weston’s communications furnished Emma with more food for unpleasant\nreflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion, and her sense of past\ninjustice towards Miss Fairfax. She bitterly regretted not having sought a\ncloser acquaintance with her, and blushed for the envious feelings which had\ncertainly been, in some measure, the cause. Had she followed Mr.\nKnightley’s known wishes, in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax, which\nwas every way her due; had she tried to know her better; had she done her part\ntowards intimacy; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in\nHarriet Smith; she must, in all probability, have been spared from every pain\nwhich pressed on her now.—Birth, abilities, and education, had been\nequally marking one as an associate for her, to be received with gratitude; and\nthe other—what was she?—Supposing even that they had never become\nintimate friends; that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax’s\nconfidence on this important matter—which was most probable—still,\nin knowing her as she ought, and as she might, she must have been preserved\nfrom the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which\nshe had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so\nunpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject\nof material distress to the delicacy of Jane’s feelings, by the levity or\ncarelessness of Frank Churchill’s. Of all the sources of evil surrounding\nthe former, since her coming to Highbury, she was persuaded that she must\nherself have been the worst. She must have been a perpetual enemy. They never\ncould have been all three together, without her having stabbed Jane\nFairfax’s peace in a thousand instances; and on Box Hill, perhaps, it had\nbeen the agony of a mind that would bear no more.',
			'The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield. The\nweather added what it could of gloom. A cold stormy rain set in, and nothing of\nJuly appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the wind was despoiling, and\nthe length of the day, which only made such cruel sights the longer visible.',
			'The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably\ncomfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter’s side, and by\nexertions which had never cost her half so much before. It reminded her of\ntheir first forlorn tête-à-tête, on the evening of Mrs. Weston’s\nwedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then, soon after tea, and\ndissipated every melancholy fancy. Alas! such delightful proofs of\nHartfield’s attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly\nbe over. The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the\napproaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them, no\npleasures had been lost.—But her present forebodings she feared would\nexperience no similar contradiction. The prospect before her now, was\nthreatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled—that might\nnot be even partially brightened. If all took place that might take place among\nthe circle of her friends, Hartfield must be comparatively deserted; and she\nleft to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness.',
			'The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself;\nand Mrs. Weston’s heart and time would be occupied by it. They should\nlose her; and, probably, in great measure, her husband also.—Frank\nChurchill would return among them no more; and Miss Fairfax, it was reasonable\nto suppose, would soon cease to belong to Highbury. They would be married, and\nsettled either at or near Enscombe. All that were good would be withdrawn; and\nif to these losses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would remain of\ncheerful or of rational society within their reach? Mr. Knightley to be no\nlonger coming there for his evening comfort!—No longer walking in at all\nhours, as if ever willing to change his own home for their’s!—How\nwas it to be endured? And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet’s\nsake; if he were to be thought of hereafter, as finding in Harriet’s\nsociety all that he wanted; if Harriet were to be the chosen, the first, the\ndearest, the friend, the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of\nexistence; what could be increasing Emma’s wretchedness but the\nreflection never far distant from her mind, that it had been all her own work?',
			'When it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain from a start,\nor a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room for a few\nseconds—and the only source whence any thing like consolation or\ncomposure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own better conduct, and\nthe hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and\nevery future winter of her life to the past, it would yet find her more\nrational, more acquainted with herself, and leave her less to regret when it\nwere gone.',

		[
			'The weather continued much the same all the following morning; and the same\nloneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign at Hartfield—but in\nthe afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into a softer quarter; the clouds\nwere carried off; the sun appeared; it was summer again. With all the eagerness\nwhich such a transition gives, Emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as\npossible. Never had the exquisite sight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil,\nwarm, and brilliant after a storm, been more attractive to her. She longed for\nthe serenity they might gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry’s coming in\nsoon after dinner, with a disengaged hour to give her father, she lost no time\nin hurrying into the shrubbery.—There, with spirits freshened, and\nthoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns, when she saw Mr.\nKnightley passing through the garden door, and coming towards her.—It was\nthe first intimation of his being returned from London. She had been thinking\nof him the moment before, as unquestionably sixteen miles distant.—There\nwas time only for the quickest arrangement of mind. She must be collected and\ncalm. In half a minute they were together. The “How d’ye\ndo’s” were quiet and constrained on each side. She asked after\ntheir mutual friends; they were all well.—When had he left\nthem?—Only that morning. He must have had a wet ride.—Yes.—He\nmeant to walk with her, she found. “He had just looked into the\ndining-room, and as he was not wanted there, preferred being out of\ndoors.”—She thought he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully; and the\nfirst possible cause for it, suggested by her fears, was, that he had perhaps\nbeen communicating his plans to his brother, and was pained by the manner in\nwhich they had been received.',
			'They walked together. He was silent. She thought he was often looking at her,\nand trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give. And this\nbelief produced another dread. Perhaps he wanted to speak to her, of his\nattachment to Harriet; he might be watching for encouragement to\nbegin.—She did not, could not, feel equal to lead the way to any such\nsubject. He must do it all himself. Yet she could not bear this silence. With\nhim it was most unnatural. She considered—resolved—and, trying to\nsmile, began—',
			'“You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather\nsurprize you.”',
			'“Have I?” said he quietly, and looking at her; “of what\nnature?”',
			'“Oh! the best nature in the world—a wedding.”',
			'After waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more, he\nreplied,',
			'“If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that\nalready.”',
			'“How is it possible?” cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks\ntowards him; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he might have called\nat Mrs. Goddard’s in his way.',
			'“I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning, and\nat the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.”',
			'Emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little more composure,',
			'“You probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you\nhave had your suspicions.—I have not forgotten that you once tried to\ngive me a caution.—I wish I had attended to it—but—(with a\nsinking voice and a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness.”',
			'For a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious of having\nexcited any particular interest, till she found her arm drawn within his, and\npressed against his heart, and heard him thus saying, in a tone of great\nsensibility, speaking low,',
			'“Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.—Your own\nexcellent sense—your exertions for your father’s sake—I know\nyou will not allow yourself—.” Her arm was pressed again, as he\nadded, in a more broken and subdued accent, “The feelings of the warmest\nfriendship—Indignation—Abominable scoundrel!”—And in a\nlouder, steadier tone, he concluded with, “He will soon be gone. They\nwill soon be in Yorkshire. I am sorry for her. She deserves a better\nfate.”',
			'Emma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of\npleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,',
			'“You are very kind—but you are mistaken—and I must set you\nright.— I am not in want of that sort of compassion. My blindness to what\nwas going on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of,\nand I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay\nme open to unpleasant conjectures, but I have no other reason to regret that I\nwas not in the secret earlier.”',
			'“Emma!” cried he, looking eagerly at her, “are you,\nindeed?”—but checking himself—“No, no, I understand\nyou—forgive me—I am pleased that you can say even so much.—He\nis no object of regret, indeed! and it will not be very long, I hope, before\nthat becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason.—Fortunate that\nyour affections were not farther entangled!—I could never, I confess,\nfrom your manners, assure myself as to the degree of what you felt—I\ncould only be certain that there was a preference—and a preference which\nI never believed him to deserve.—He is a disgrace to the name of\nman.—And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?—Jane,\nJane, you will be a miserable creature.”',
			'“Mr. Knightley,” said Emma, trying to be lively, but really\nconfused—“I am in a very extraordinary situation. I cannot let you\ncontinue in your error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an\nimpression, I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have\nbeen at all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might be natural\nfor a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.—But I never\nhave.”',
			'He listened in perfect silence. She wished him to speak, but he would not. She\nsupposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency; but it was\na hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion. She went on,\nhowever.',
			'“I have very little to say for my own conduct.—I was tempted by his\nattentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.—An old story,\nprobably—a common case—and no more than has happened to hundreds of\nmy sex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as I\ndo for Understanding. Many circumstances assisted the temptation. He was the\nson of Mr. Weston—he was continually here—I always found him very\npleasant—and, in short, for (with a sigh) let me swell out the causes\never so ingeniously, they all centre in this at last—my vanity was\nflattered, and I allowed his attentions. Latterly, however—for some time,\nindeed—I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.—I thought\nthem a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side. He has\nimposed on me, but he has not injured me. I have never been attached to him.\nAnd now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour. He never wished to attach me.\nIt was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another.—It was\nhis object to blind all about him; and no one, I am sure, could be more\neffectually blinded than myself—except that I was not\nblinded—that it was my good fortune—that, in short, I was somehow\nor other safe from him.”',
			'She had hoped for an answer here—for a few words to say that her conduct\nwas at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far as she could judge,\ndeep in thought. At last, and tolerably in his usual tone, he said,',
			'“I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.—I can suppose,\nhowever, that I may have underrated him. My acquaintance with him has been but\ntrifling.—And even if I have not underrated him hitherto, he may yet turn\nout well.—With such a woman he has a chance.—I have no motive for\nwishing him ill—and for her sake, whose happiness will be involved in his\ngood character and conduct, I shall certainly wish him well.”',
			'“I have no doubt of their being happy together,” said Emma;\n“I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached.”',
			'“He is a most fortunate man!” returned Mr. Knightley, with energy.\n“So early in life—at three-and-twenty—a period when, if a man\nchuses a wife, he generally chuses ill. At three-and-twenty to have drawn such\na prize! What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation, has before\nhim!—Assured of the love of such a woman—the disinterested love,\nfor Jane Fairfax’s character vouches for her disinterestedness; every\nthing in his favour,—equality of situation—I mean, as far as\nregards society, and all the habits and manners that are important; equality in\nevery point but one—and that one, since the purity of her heart is not to\nbe doubted, such as must increase his felicity, for it will be his to bestow\nthe only advantages she wants.—A man would always wish to give a woman a\nbetter home than the one he takes her from; and he who can do it, where there\nis no doubt of her regard, must, I think, be the happiest of\nmortals.—Frank Churchill is, indeed, the favourite of fortune. Every\nthing turns out for his good.—He meets with a young woman at a\nwatering-place, gains her affection, cannot even weary her by negligent\ntreatment—and had he and all his family sought round the world for a\nperfect wife for him, they could not have found her superior.—His aunt is\nin the way.—His aunt dies.—He has only to speak.—His friends\nare eager to promote his happiness.—He had used every body ill—and\nthey are all delighted to forgive him.—He is a fortunate man\nindeed!”',
			'“You speak as if you envied him.”',
			'“And I do envy him, Emma. In one respect he is the object of my\nenvy.”',
			'Emma could say no more. They seemed to be within half a sentence of Harriet,\nand her immediate feeling was to avert the subject, if possible. She made her\nplan; she would speak of something totally different—the children in\nBrunswick Square; and she only waited for breath to begin, when Mr. Knightley\nstartled her, by saying,',
			'“You will not ask me what is the point of envy.—You are determined,\nI see, to have no curiosity.—You are wise—but I cannot be\nwise. Emma, I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid\nthe next moment.”',
			'“Oh! then, don’t speak it, don’t speak it,” she eagerly\ncried. “Take a little time, consider, do not commit yourself.”',
			'“Thank you,” said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not\nanother syllable followed.',
			'Emma could not bear to give him pain. He was wishing to confide in\nher—perhaps to consult her;—cost her what it would, she would\nlisten. She might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it; she might give\njust praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him his own independence,\nrelieve him from that state of indecision, which must be more intolerable than\nany alternative to such a mind as his.—They had reached the house.',
			'“You are going in, I suppose?” said he.',
			'“No,”—replied Emma—quite confirmed by the depressed\nmanner in which he still spoke—“I should like to take another turn.\nMr. Perry is not gone.” And, after proceeding a few steps, she\nadded—“I stopped you ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I\nam afraid, gave you pain.—But if you have any wish to speak openly to me\nas a friend, or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in\ncontemplation—as a friend, indeed, you may command me.—I will hear\nwhatever you like. I will tell you exactly what I think.”',
			'“As a friend!”—repeated Mr. Knightley.—“Emma,\nthat I fear is a word—No, I have no wish—Stay, yes, why should I\nhesitate?—I have gone too far already for concealment.—Emma, I\naccept your offer—Extraordinary as it may seem, I accept it, and refer\nmyself to you as a friend.—Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever\nsucceeding?”',
			'He stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression of his\neyes overpowered her.',
			'“My dearest Emma,” said he, “for dearest you will always be,\nwhatever the event of this hour’s conversation, my dearest, most beloved\nEmma—tell me at once. Say ‘No,’ if it is to be\nsaid.”—She could really say nothing.—“You are\nsilent,” he cried, with great animation; “absolutely silent! at\npresent I ask no more.”',
			'Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment. The dread of\nbeing awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most prominent feeling.',
			'“I cannot make speeches, Emma:” he soon resumed; and in a tone of\nsuch sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably\nconvincing.—“If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it\nmore. But you know what I am.—You hear nothing but truth from me.—I\nhave blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other woman in\nEngland would have borne it.—Bear with the truths I would tell you now,\ndearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them. The manner, perhaps, may\nhave as little to recommend them. God knows, I have been a very indifferent\nlover.—But you understand me.—Yes, you see, you understand my\nfeelings—and will return them if you can. At present, I ask only to hear,\nonce to hear your voice.”',
			'While he spoke, Emma’s mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful\nvelocity of thought, had been able—and yet without losing a word—to\ncatch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that Harriet’s\nhopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion, as complete a\ndelusion as any of her own—that Harriet was nothing; that she was every\nthing herself; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all\ntaken as the language of her own feelings; and that her agitation, her doubts,\nher reluctance, her discouragement, had been all received as discouragement\nfrom herself.—And not only was there time for these convictions, with all\ntheir glow of attendant happiness; there was time also to rejoice that\nHarriet’s secret had not escaped her, and to resolve that it need not,\nand should not.—It was all the service she could now render her poor\nfriend; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted\nher to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet, as\ninfinitely the most worthy of the two—or even the more simple sublimity\nof resolving to refuse him at once and for ever, without vouchsafing any\nmotive, because he could not marry them both, Emma had it not. She felt for\nHarriet, with pain and with contrition; but no flight of generosity run mad,\nopposing all that could be probable or reasonable, entered her brain. She had\nled her friend astray, and it would be a reproach to her for ever; but her\njudgment was as strong as her feelings, and as strong as it had ever been\nbefore, in reprobating any such alliance for him, as most unequal and\ndegrading. Her way was clear, though not quite smooth.—She spoke then, on\nbeing so entreated.—What did she say?—Just what she ought, of\ncourse. A lady always does.—She said enough to shew there need not be\ndespair—and to invite him to say more himself. He had despaired at\none period; he had received such an injunction to caution and silence, as for\nthe time crushed every hope;—she had begun by refusing to hear\nhim.—The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden;—her proposal of\ntaking another turn, her renewing the conversation which she had just put an\nend to, might be a little extraordinary!—She felt its inconsistency; but\nMr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it, and seek no farther\nexplanation.',
			'Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure; seldom\ncan it happen that something is not a little disguised, or a little mistaken;\nbut where, as in this case, though the conduct is mistaken, the feelings are\nnot, it may not be very material.—Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma\na more relenting heart than she possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept\nof his.',
			'He had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence. He had followed\nher into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it. He had come, in his anxiety\nto see how she bore Frank Churchill’s engagement, with no selfish view,\nno view at all, but of endeavouring, if she allowed him an opening, to soothe\nor to counsel her.—The rest had been the work of the moment, the\nimmediate effect of what he heard, on his feelings. The delightful assurance of\nher total indifference towards Frank Churchill, of her having a heart\ncompletely disengaged from him, had given birth to the hope, that, in time, he\nmight gain her affection himself;—but it had been no present\nhope—he had only, in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment,\naspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her.—The\nsuperior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more\nenchanting.—The affection, which he had been asking to be allowed to\ncreate, if he could, was already his!—Within half an hour, he had passed\nfrom a thoroughly distressed state of mind, to something so like perfect\nhappiness, that it could bear no other name.',
			'Her change was equal.—This one half-hour had given to each the\nsame precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each the same degree\nof ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.—On his side, there had been a\nlong-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the expectation, of Frank\nChurchill.—He had been in love with Emma, and jealous of Frank Churchill,\nfrom about the same period, one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to\nthe other. It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from the\ncountry.—The Box Hill party had decided him on going away. He would save\nhimself from witnessing again such permitted, encouraged attentions.—He\nhad gone to learn to be indifferent.—But he had gone to a wrong place.\nThere was too much domestic happiness in his brother’s house; woman wore\ntoo amiable a form in it; Isabella was too much like Emma—differing only\nin those striking inferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy\nbefore him, for much to have been done, even had his time been longer.—He\nhad stayed on, however, vigorously, day after day—till this very\nmorning’s post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.—Then, with\nthe gladness which must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to feel, having\nnever believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma, was there so much\nfond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her, that he could stay no longer. He\nhad ridden home through the rain; and had walked up directly after dinner, to\nsee how this sweetest and best of all creatures, faultless in spite of all her\nfaults, bore the discovery.',
			'He had found her agitated and low.—Frank Churchill was a villain.—\nHe heard her declare that she had never loved him. Frank Churchill’s\ncharacter was not desperate.—She was his own Emma, by hand and word, when\nthey returned into the house; and if he could have thought of Frank Churchill\nthen, he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow.',
		],
		[
			'What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from what she\nhad brought out!—she had then been only daring to hope for a little\nrespite of suffering;—she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness,\nand such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the\nflutter should have passed away.',
			'They sat down to tea—the same party round the same table—how often\nit had been collected!—and how often had her eyes fallen on the same\nshrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect of the western\nsun!—But never in such a state of spirits, never in any thing like it;\nand it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be\nthe attentive lady of the house, or even the attentive daughter.',
			'Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast\nof that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so anxiously hoping might\nnot have taken cold from his ride.—Could he have seen the heart, he would\nhave cared very little for the lungs; but without the most distant imagination\nof the impending evil, without the slightest perception of any thing\nextraordinary in the looks or ways of either, he repeated to them very\ncomfortably all the articles of news he had received from Mr. Perry, and talked\non with much self-contentment, totally unsuspicious of what they could have\ntold him in return.',
			'As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma’s fever continued; but\nwhen he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued—and\nin the course of the sleepless night, which was the tax for such an evening,\nshe found one or two such very serious points to consider, as made her feel,\nthat even her happiness must have some alloy. Her father—and Harriet. She\ncould not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims;\nand how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost, was the question. With\nrespect to her father, it was a question soon answered. She hardly knew yet\nwhat Mr. Knightley would ask; but a very short parley with her own heart\nproduced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father.—She\neven wept over the idea of it, as a sin of thought. While he lived, it must be\nonly an engagement; but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger\nof drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.—How\nto do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;—how to spare\nher from any unnecessary pain; how to make her any possible atonement; how to\nappear least her enemy?—On these subjects, her perplexity and distress\nwere very great—and her mind had to pass again and again through every\nbitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.—She\ncould only resolve at last, that she would still avoid a meeting with her, and\ncommunicate all that need be told by letter; that it would be inexpressibly\ndesirable to have her removed just now for a time from Highbury,\nand—indulging in one scheme more—nearly resolve, that it might be\npracticable to get an invitation for her to Brunswick Square.—Isabella\nhad been pleased with Harriet; and a few weeks spent in London must give her\nsome amusement.—She did not think it in Harriet’s nature to escape\nbeing benefited by novelty and variety, by the streets, the shops, and the\nchildren.—At any rate, it would be a proof of attention and kindness in\nherself, from whom every thing was due; a separation for the present; an\naverting of the evil day, when they must all be together again.',
			'She rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment which left her\nso very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley, in walking up to Hartfield\nto breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon; and half an hour stolen\nafterwards to go over the same ground again with him, literally and\nfiguratively, was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the\nhappiness of the evening before.',
			'He had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have the slightest\ninclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter was brought her from\nRandalls—a very thick letter;—she guessed what it must contain, and\ndeprecated the necessity of reading it.—She was now in perfect charity\nwith Frank Churchill; she wanted no explanations, she wanted only to have her\nthoughts to herself—and as for understanding any thing he wrote, she was\nsure she was incapable of it.—It must be waded through, however. She\nopened the packet; it was too surely so;—a note from Mrs. Weston to\nherself, ushered in the letter from Frank to Mrs. Weston.',
			'“I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding to you the\nenclosed. I know what thorough justice you will do it, and have scarcely a\ndoubt of its happy effect.—I think we shall never materially disagree\nabout the writer again; but I will not delay you by a long preface.—We\nare quite well.—This letter has been the cure of all the little\nnervousness I have been feeling lately.—I did not quite like your looks\non Tuesday, but it was an ungenial morning; and though you will never own being\naffected by weather, I think every body feels a north-east wind.—I felt\nfor your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday afternoon and yesterday\nmorning, but had the comfort of hearing last night, by Mr. Perry, that it had\nnot made him ill.',
			'“Yours ever,          \n“A. W.”',
			'[To Mrs. Weston.]',
			'Windsor—July.',
			'MY DEAR MADAM,',
			'“If I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will be expected;\nbut expected or not, I know it will be read with candour and\nindulgence.—You are all goodness, and I believe there will be need of\neven all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.—But I\nhave been forgiven by one who had still more to resent. My courage rises while\nI write. It is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble. I have already\nmet with such success in two applications for pardon, that I may be in danger\nof thinking myself too sure of yours, and of those among your friends who have\nhad any ground of offence.—You must all endeavour to comprehend the exact\nnature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls; you must consider me\nas having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards. This was the fact. My\nright to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment, is another\nquestion. I shall not discuss it here. For my temptation to think it a\nright, I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below, and\ncasements above, in Highbury. I dared not address her openly; my difficulties\nin the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition; and\nI was fortunate enough to prevail, before we parted at Weymouth, and to induce\nthe most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret\nengagement.—Had she refused, I should have gone mad.—But you will\nbe ready to say, what was your hope in doing this?—What did you look\nforward to?—To any thing, every thing—to time, chance,\ncircumstance, slow effects, sudden bursts, perseverance and weariness, health\nand sickness. Every possibility of good was before me, and the first of\nblessings secured, in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence. If\nyou need farther explanation, I have the honour, my dear madam, of being your\nhusband’s son, and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for\ngood, which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value\nof.—See me, then, under these circumstances, arriving on my first visit\nto Randalls;—and here I am conscious of wrong, for that visit might have\nbeen sooner paid. You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss\nFairfax was in Highbury; and as you were the person slighted, you will\nforgive me instantly; but I must work on my father’s compassion, by\nreminding him, that so long as I absented myself from his house, so long I lost\nthe blessing of knowing you. My behaviour, during the very happy fortnight\nwhich I spent with you, did not, I hope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting\non one point. And now I come to the principal, the only important part of my\nconduct while belonging to you, which excites my own anxiety, or requires very\nsolicitous explanation. With the greatest respect, and the warmest friendship,\ndo I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father perhaps will think I ought to add, with\nthe deepest humiliation.—A few words which dropped from him yesterday\nspoke his opinion, and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.—My\nbehaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more than it ought.—In\norder to assist a concealment so essential to me, I was led on to make more\nthan an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately\nthrown.—I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible\nobject—but I am sure you will believe the declaration, that had I not\nbeen convinced of her indifference, I would not have been induced by any\nselfish views to go on.—Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she\nnever gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached; and that she was\nperfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me, was as much my\nconviction as my wish.—She received my attentions with an easy, friendly,\ngoodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me. We seemed to understand each\nother. From our relative situation, those attentions were her due, and were\nfelt to be so.—Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand me\nbefore the expiration of that fortnight, I cannot say;—when I called to\ntake leave of her, I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the\ntruth, and I then fancied she was not without suspicion; but I have no doubt of\nher having since detected me, at least in some degree.—She may not have\nsurmised the whole, but her quickness must have penetrated a part. I cannot\ndoubt it. You will find, whenever the subject becomes freed from its present\nrestraints, that it did not take her wholly by surprize. She frequently gave me\nhints of it. I remember her telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton\ngratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.—I hope this history of my\nconduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation\nof what you saw amiss. While you considered me as having sinned against Emma\nWoodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either. Acquit me here, and procure for\nme, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma\nWoodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly affection, as to long to have\nher as deeply and as happily in love as myself.—Whatever strange things I\nsaid or did during that fortnight, you have now a key to. My heart was in\nHighbury, and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be, and\nwith the least suspicion. If you remember any queernesses, set them all to the\nright account.—Of the pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only\nnecessary to say, that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss\nF—, who would never have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given\nher.—The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear\nmadam, is much beyond my power of doing justice to. You will soon, I earnestly\nhope, know her thoroughly yourself.—No description can describe her. She\nmust tell you herself what she is—yet not by word, for never was there a\nhuman creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit.—Since I\nbegan this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard from\nher.—She gives a good account of her own health; but as she never\ncomplains, I dare not depend. I want to have your opinion of her looks. I know\nyou will soon call on her; she is living in dread of the visit. Perhaps it is\npaid already. Let me hear from you without delay; I am impatient for a thousand\nparticulars. Remember how few minutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered,\nhow mad a state: and I am not much better yet; still insane either from\nhappiness or misery. When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with,\nof her excellence and patience, and my uncle’s generosity, I am mad with\njoy: but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her, and how little I\ndeserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger. If I could but see her\nagain!—But I must not propose it yet. My uncle has been too good for me\nto encroach.—I must still add to this long letter. You have not heard all\nthat you ought to hear. I could not give any connected detail yesterday; but\nthe suddenness, and, in one light, the unseasonableness with which the affair\nburst out, needs explanation; for though the event of the 26th ult., as you\nwill conclude, immediately opened to me the happiest prospects, I should not\nhave presumed on such early measures, but from the very particular\ncircumstances, which left me not an hour to lose. I should myself have shrunk\nfrom any thing so hasty, and she would have felt every scruple of mine with\nmultiplied strength and refinement.—But I had no choice. The hasty\nengagement she had entered into with that woman—Here, my dear madam, I\nwas obliged to leave off abruptly, to recollect and compose myself.—I\nhave been walking over the country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to make\nthe rest of my letter what it ought to be.—It is, in fact, a most\nmortifying retrospect for me. I behaved shamefully. And here I can admit, that\nmy manners to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highly blameable.\nShe disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.—My plea of\nconcealing the truth she did not think sufficient.—She was displeased; I\nthought unreasonably so: I thought her, on a thousand occasions, unnecessarily\nscrupulous and cautious: I thought her even cold. But she was always right. If\nI had followed her judgment, and subdued my spirits to the level of what she\ndeemed proper, I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever\nknown.—We quarrelled.— Do you remember the morning spent at\nDonwell?—There every little dissatisfaction that had occurred\nbefore came to a crisis. I was late; I met her walking home by herself, and\nwanted to walk with her, but she would not suffer it. She absolutely refused to\nallow me, which I then thought most unreasonable. Now, however, I see nothing\nin it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion. While I, to blind\nthe world to our engagement, was behaving one hour with objectionable\nparticularity to another woman, was she to be consenting the next to a proposal\nwhich might have made every previous caution useless?—Had we been met\nwalking together between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been\nsuspected.—I was mad enough, however, to resent.—I doubted her\naffection. I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by such\nconduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect of her, and such apparent\ndevotion to Miss W., as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to\nendure, she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to\nme.—In short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side,\nabominable on mine; and I returned the same evening to Richmond, though I might\nhave staid with you till the next morning, merely because I would be as angry\nwith her as possible. Even then, I was not such a fool as not to mean to be\nreconciled in time; but I was the injured person, injured by her coldness, and\nI went away determined that she should make the first advances.—I shall\nalways congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party. Had you\nwitnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought\nwell of me again. Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it\nproduced: as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls, she closed with\nthe offer of that officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of\nher, by the bye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred. I must not\nquarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards\nmyself; but, otherwise, I should loudly protest against the share of it which\nthat woman has known.—‘Jane,’ indeed!—You will observe\nthat I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name, even to you.\nThink, then, what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons\nwith all the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the insolence of\nimaginary superiority. Have patience with me, I shall soon have done.—She\nclosed with this offer, resolving to break with me entirely, and wrote the next\nday to tell me that we never were to meet again.—She felt\nthe engagement to be a source\nof repentance and misery to each:\nshe dissolved it.—This letter reached me on the very\nmorning of my poor aunt’s death. I answered it within an hour; but from\nthe confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity of business falling on me at\nonce, my answer, instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that\nday, was locked up in my writing-desk; and I, trusting that I had written\nenough, though but a few lines, to satisfy her, remained without any\nuneasiness.—I was rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again\nspeedily; but I made excuses for her, and was too busy, and—may I\nadd?—too cheerful in my views to be captious.—We removed to\nWindsor; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters\nall returned!—and a few lines at the same time by the post, stating her\nextreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last; and adding,\nthat as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued, and as it must be\nequally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as\nsoon as possible, she now sent me, by a safe conveyance, all my letters, and\nrequested, that if I could not directly command hers, so as to send them to\nHighbury within a week, I would forward them after that period to her\nat—: in short, the full direction to Mr. Smallridge’s, near\nBristol, stared me in the face. I knew the name, the place, I knew all about\nit, and instantly saw what she had been doing. It was perfectly accordant with\nthat resolution of character which I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she\nhad maintained, as to any such design in her former letter, was equally\ndescriptive of its anxious delicacy. For the world would not she have seemed to\nthreaten me.—Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I had actually detected\nmy own blunder, I raved at the blunders of the post.—What was to be\ndone?—One thing only.—I must speak to my uncle. Without his\nsanction I could not hope to be listened to again.—I spoke; circumstances\nwere in my favour; the late event had softened away his pride, and he was,\nearlier than I could have anticipated, wholly reconciled and complying; and\ncould say at last, poor man! with a deep sigh, that he wished I might find as\nmuch happiness in the marriage state as he had done.—I felt that it would\nbe of a different sort.—Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have\nsuffered in opening the cause to him, for my suspense while all was at\nstake?—No; do not pity me till I reached Highbury, and saw how ill I had\nmade her. Do not pity me till I saw her wan, sick looks.—I reached\nHighbury at the time of day when, from my knowledge of their late breakfast\nhour, I was certain of a good chance of finding her alone.—I was not\ndisappointed; and at last I was not disappointed either in the object of my\njourney. A great deal of very reasonable, very just displeasure I had to\npersuade away. But it is done; we are reconciled, dearer, much dearer, than\never, and no moment’s uneasiness can ever occur between us again. Now, my\ndear madam, I will release you; but I could not conclude before. A thousand and\na thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me, and ten thousand\nfor the attentions your heart will dictate towards her.—If you think me\nin a way to be happier than I deserve, I am quite of your opinion.—Miss\nW. calls me the child of good fortune. I hope she is right.—In one\nrespect, my good fortune is undoubted, that of being able to subscribe myself,',

		[
			'This letter must make its way to Emma’s feelings. She was obliged, in\nspite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do it all the justice\nthat Mrs. Weston foretold. As soon as she came to her own name, it was\nirresistible; every line relating to herself was interesting, and almost every\nline agreeable; and when this charm ceased, the subject could still maintain\nitself, by the natural return of her former regard for the writer, and the very\nstrong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment.\nShe never stopt till she had gone through the whole; and though it was\nimpossible not to feel that he had been wrong, yet he had been less wrong than\nshe had supposed—and he had suffered, and was very sorry—and he was\nso grateful to Mrs. Weston, and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was\nso happy herself, that there was no being severe; and could he have entered the\nroom, she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever.',
			'She thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again, she\ndesired him to read it. She was sure of Mrs. Weston’s wishing it to be\ncommunicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley, had seen so much to\nblame in his conduct.',
			'“I shall be very glad to look it over,” said he; “but it\nseems long. I will take it home with me at night.”',
			'But that would not do. Mr. Weston was to call in the evening, and she must\nreturn it by him.',
			'“I would rather be talking to you,” he replied; “but as it\nseems a matter of justice, it shall be done.”',
			'He began—stopping, however, almost directly to say, “Had I been\noffered the sight of one of this gentleman’s letters to his mother-in-law\na few months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such\nindifference.”',
			'He proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with a smile,\nobserved, “Humph! a fine complimentary opening: But it is his way. One\nman’s style must not be the rule of another’s. We will not be\nsevere.”',
			'“It will be natural for me,” he added shortly afterwards, “to\nspeak my opinion aloud as I read. By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you.\nIt will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislike it—”',
			'“Not at all. I should wish it.”',
			'Mr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.',
			'“He trifles here,” said he, “as to the temptation. He knows\nhe is wrong, and has nothing rational to urge.—Bad.—He ought not to\nhave formed the engagement.—‘His father’s\ndisposition:’—he is unjust, however, to his father. Mr.\nWeston’s sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable\nexertions; but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to\ngain it.—Very true; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here.”',
			'“And I have not forgotten,” said Emma, “how sure you were\nthat he might have come sooner if he would. You pass it over very\nhandsomely—but you were perfectly right.”',
			'“I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:—but yet, I\nthink—had you not been in the case—I should still have\ndistrusted him.”',
			'When he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole of it\naloud—all that related to her, with a smile; a look; a shake of the head;\na word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely of love, as the subject\nrequired; concluding, however, seriously, and, after steady reflection,\nthus—',
			'“Very bad—though it might have been worse.—Playing a most\ndangerous game. Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.—No\njudge of his own manners by you.—Always deceived in fact by his own\nwishes, and regardless of little besides his own convenience.—Fancying\nyou to have fathomed his secret. Natural enough!—his own mind full of\nintrigue, that he should suspect it in others.—Mystery; Finesse—how\nthey pervert the understanding! My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove\nmore and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each\nother?”',
			'Emma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet’s account,\nwhich she could not give any sincere explanation of.',
			'“You had better go on,” said she.',
			'He did so, but very soon stopt again to say, “the pianoforte! Ah! That\nwas the act of a very, very young man, one too young to consider whether the\ninconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure. A boyish scheme,\nindeed!—I cannot comprehend a man’s wishing to give a woman any\nproof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with; and he did\nknow that she would have prevented the instrument’s coming if she\ncould.”',
			'After this, he made some progress without any pause. Frank Churchill’s\nconfession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more\nthan a word in passing.',
			'“I perfectly agree with you, sir,”—was then his remark.\n“You did behave very shamefully. You never wrote a truer line.” And\nhaving gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their\ndisagreement, and his persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane\nFairfax’s sense of right, he made a fuller pause to say, “This is\nvery bad.—He had induced her to place herself, for his sake, in a\nsituation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness, and it should have been his\nfirst object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily.—She must have\nhad much more to contend with, in carrying on the correspondence, than he\ncould. He should have respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been\nsuch; but hers were all reasonable. We must look to her one fault, and remember\nthat she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement, to bear that\nshe should have been in such a state of punishment.”',
			'Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grew\nuncomfortable. Her own behaviour had been so very improper! She was deeply\nashamed, and a little afraid of his next look. It was all read, however,\nsteadily, attentively, and without the smallest remark; and, excepting one\nmomentary glance at her, instantly withdrawn, in the fear of giving\npain—no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist.',
			'“There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, the\nEltons,” was his next observation.—“His feelings are\nnatural.—What! actually resolve to break with him entirely!—She\nfelt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each—she\ndissolved it.—What a view this gives of her sense of his\nbehaviour!—Well, he must be a most extraordinary—”',
			'“Nay, nay, read on.—You will find how very much he suffers.”',
			'“I hope he does,” replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the\nletter. “‘Smallridge!’—What does this mean? What is all\nthis?”',
			'“She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge’s\nchildren—a dear friend of Mrs. Elton’s—a neighbour of Maple\nGrove; and, by the bye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the\ndisappointment?”',
			'“Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read—not even of\nMrs. Elton. Only one page more. I shall soon have done. What a letter the man\nwrites!”',
			'“I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him.”',
			'“Well, there is feeling here.—He does seem to have suffered\nin finding her ill.—Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fond of\nher. ‘Dearer, much dearer than ever.’ I hope he may long continue\nto feel all the value of such a reconciliation.—He is a very liberal\nthanker, with his thousands and tens of thousands.—‘Happier than I\ndeserve.’ Come, he knows himself there. ‘Miss Woodhouse calls me\nthe child of good fortune.’—Those were Miss Woodhouse’s\nwords, were they?— And a fine ending—and there is the letter. The\nchild of good fortune! That was your name for him, was it?”',
			'“You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am; but still\nyou must, at least I hope you must, think the better of him for it. I hope it\ndoes him some service with you.”',
			'“Yes, certainly it does. He has had great faults, faults of\ninconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his opinion in\nthinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: but still as he is, beyond\na doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, it may be hoped, have\nthe advantage of being constantly with her, I am very ready to believe his\ncharacter will improve, and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of\nprinciple that it wants. And now, let me talk to you of something else. I have\nanother person’s interest at present so much at heart, that I cannot\nthink any longer about Frank Churchill. Ever since I left you this morning,\nEmma, my mind has been hard at work on one subject.”',
			'The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike English, such\nas Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with, how to be able to\nask her to marry him, without attacking the happiness of her father.\nEmma’s answer was ready at the first word. “While her dear father\nlived, any change of condition must be impossible for her. She could never quit\nhim.” Part only of this answer, however, was admitted. The impossibility\nof her quitting her father, Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the\ninadmissibility of any other change, he could not agree to. He had been\nthinking it over most deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to induce\nMr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to believe it\nfeasible, but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive\nhimself long; and now he confessed his persuasion, that such a transplantation\nwould be a risk of her father’s comfort, perhaps even of his life, which\nmust not be hazarded. Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!—No, he felt\nthat it ought not to be attempted. But the plan which had arisen on the\nsacrifice of this, he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect\nobjectionable; it was, that he should be received at Hartfield; that so long as\nher father’s happiness—in other words, his life—required\nHartfield to continue her home, it should be his likewise.',
			'Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own passing\nthoughts. Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it; but such an\nalternative as this had not occurred to her. She was sensible of all the\naffection it evinced. She felt that, in quitting Donwell, he must be\nsacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits; that in living\nconstantly with her father, and in no house of his own, there would be much,\nvery much, to be borne with. She promised to think of it, and advised him to\nthink of it more; but he was fully convinced, that no reflection could alter\nhis wishes or his opinion on the subject. He had given it, he could assure her,\nvery long and calm consideration; he had been walking away from William Larkins\nthe whole morning, to have his thoughts to himself.',
			'“Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for,” cried Emma. “I\nam sure William Larkins will not like it. You must get his consent before you\nask mine.”',
			'She promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised, moreover, to\nthink of it, with the intention of finding it a very good scheme.',
			'It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view in which\nshe was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never struck with any\nsense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights as heir-expectant had\nformerly been so tenaciously regarded. Think she must of the possible\ndifference to the poor little boy; and yet she only gave herself a saucy\nconscious smile about it, and found amusement in detecting the real cause of\nthat violent dislike of Mr. Knightley’s marrying Jane Fairfax, or any\nbody else, which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude\nof the sister and the aunt.',
			'This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at\nHartfield—the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became. His\nevils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase, their mutual good to\noutweigh every drawback. Such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety\nand cheerlessness before her!—Such a partner in all those duties and\ncares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy!',
			'She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every blessing of her\nown seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend, who must now be\neven excluded from Hartfield. The delightful family party which Emma was\nsecuring for herself, poor Harriet must, in mere charitable caution, be kept at\na distance from. She would be a loser in every way. Emma could not deplore her\nfuture absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment. In such a party,\nHarriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise; but for the poor girl\nherself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in\nsuch a state of unmerited punishment.',
			'In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is, supplanted; but\nthis could not be expected to happen very early. Mr. Knightley himself would be\ndoing nothing to assist the cure;—not like Mr. Elton. Mr. Knightley,\nalways so kind, so feeling, so truly considerate for every body, would never\ndeserve to be less worshipped than now; and it really was too much to hope even\nof Harriet, that she could be in love with more than three men in one\nyear.',
		],
		[
			'It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as herself to\navoid a meeting. Their intercourse was painful enough by letter. How much\nworse, had they been obliged to meet!',
			'Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed, without reproaches,\nor apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of\nresentment, a something bordering on it in her style, which increased the\ndesirableness of their being separate.—It might be only her own\nconsciousness; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without\nresentment under such a stroke.',
			'She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella’s invitation; and she was\nfortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it, without resorting to\ninvention.—There was a tooth amiss. Harriet really wished, and had wished\nsome time, to consult a dentist. Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of\nuse; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her—and though not\nso fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet\nunder her care.—When it was thus settled on her sister’s side, Emma\nproposed it to her friend, and found her very persuadable.—Harriet was to\ngo; she was invited for at least a fortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr.\nWoodhouse’s carriage.—It was all arranged, it was all completed,\nand Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square.',
			'Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley’s visits; now she could talk,\nand she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that sense of injustice,\nof guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted her when remembering how\ndisappointed a heart was near her, how much might at that moment, and at a\nlittle distance, be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself.',
			'The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard’s, or in London, made perhaps\nan unreasonable difference in Emma’s sensations; but she could not think\nof her in London without objects of curiosity and employment, which must be\naverting the past, and carrying her out of herself.',
			'She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her\nmind which Harriet had occupied. There was a communication before her, one\nwhich she only could be competent to make—the confession of her\nengagement to her father; but she would have nothing to do with it at\npresent.—She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs. Weston were\nsafe and well. No additional agitation should be thrown at this period among\nthose she loved—and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation\nbefore the appointed time.—A fortnight, at least, of leisure and peace of\nmind, to crown every warmer, but more agitating, delight, should be hers.',
			'She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half an hour of\nthis holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.—She ought to\ngo—and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of their present\nsituations increasing every other motive of goodwill. It would be a\nsecret satisfaction; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect\nwould certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing\nJane might communicate.',
			'She went—she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had not been\ninto the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor Jane had been in\nsuch distress as had filled her with compassion, though all the worst of her\nsufferings had been unsuspected.—The fear of being still unwelcome,\ndetermined her, though assured of their being at home, to wait in the passage,\nand send up her name.—She heard Patty announcing it; but no such bustle\nsucceeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.—No;\nshe heard nothing but the instant reply of, “Beg her to walk\nup;”—and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane\nherself, coming eagerly forward, as if no other reception of her were felt\nsufficient.—Emma had never seen her look so well, so lovely, so engaging.\nThere was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was every thing which her\ncountenance or manner could ever have wanted.— She came forward with an\noffered hand; and said, in a low, but very feeling tone,',
			'“This is most kind, indeed!—Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for me\nto express—I hope you will believe—Excuse me for being so entirely\nwithout words.”',
			'Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, if the sound of\nMrs. Elton’s voice from the sitting-room had not checked her, and made it\nexpedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations\ninto a very, very earnest shake of the hand.',
			'Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together. Miss Bates was out, which accounted\nfor the previous tranquillity. Emma could have wished Mrs. Elton elsewhere; but\nshe was in a humour to have patience with every body; and as Mrs. Elton met her\nwith unusual graciousness, she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm.',
			'She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton’s thoughts, and\nunderstand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being in Miss\nFairfax’s confidence, and fancying herself acquainted with what was still\na secret to other people. Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression\nof her face; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs. Bates, and appearing\nto attend to the good old lady’s replies, she saw her with a sort of\nanxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been\nreading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into the purple and gold reticule\nby her side, saying, with significant nods,',
			'“We can finish this some other time, you know. You and I shall not want\nopportunities. And, in fact, you have heard all the essential already. I only\nwanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology, and is not offended.\nYou see how delightfully she writes. Oh! she is a sweet creature! You would\nhave doated on her, had you gone.—But not a word more. Let us be\ndiscreet—quite on our good behaviour.—Hush!—You remember\nthose lines—I forget the poem at this moment:',
			'“For when a lady’s in the case,\n“You know all other things give place.”',
			'Now I say, my dear, in our case, for lady, read——mum!\na word to the wise.—I am in a fine flow of spirits, an’t I? But I\nwant to set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.—My representation,\nyou see, has quite appeased her.”',
			'And again, on Emma’s merely turning her head to look at Mrs.\nBates’s knitting, she added, in a half whisper,',
			'“I mentioned no names, you will observe.—Oh! no; cautious as\na minister of state. I managed it extremely well.”',
			'Emma could not doubt. It was a palpable display, repeated on every possible\noccasion. When they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and\nMrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed with,',
			'“Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is\ncharmingly recovered?—Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest\ncredit?—(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.) Upon my word,\nPerry has restored her in a wonderful short time!—Oh! if you had seen\nher, as I did, when she was at the worst!”—And when Mrs. Bates was\nsaying something to Emma, whispered farther, “We do not say a word of any\nassistance that Perry might have; not a word of a certain young\nphysician from Windsor.—Oh! no; Perry shall have all the credit.”',
			'“I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,” she\nshortly afterwards began, “since the party to Box Hill. Very pleasant\nparty. But yet I think there was something wanting. Things did not\nseem—that is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of\nsome.—So it appeared to me at least, but I might be mistaken. However, I\nthink it answered so far as to tempt one to go again. What say you both to our\ncollecting the same party, and exploring to Box Hill again, while the fine\nweather lasts?—It must be the same party, you know, quite the same party,\nnot one exception.”',
			'Soon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being diverted by\nthe perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting, she supposed, from\ndoubt of what might be said, and impatience to say every thing.',
			'“Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.—It is\nimpossible to say—Yes, indeed, I quite understand—dearest\nJane’s prospects—that is, I do not mean.—But she is\ncharmingly recovered.—How is Mr. Woodhouse?—I am so\nglad.—Quite out of my power.—Such a happy little circle as you find\nus here.—Yes, indeed.—Charming young man!—that is—so\nvery friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!—such attention to\nJane!”—And from her great, her more than commonly thankful delight\ntowards Mrs. Elton for being there, Emma guessed that there had been a little\nshow of resentment towards Jane, from the vicarage quarter, which was now\ngraciously overcome.—After a few whispers, indeed, which placed it beyond\na guess, Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,',
			'“Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long, that\nanywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise; but, the truth is, that\nI am waiting for my lord and master. He promised to join me here, and pay his\nrespects to you.”',
			'“What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?—That\nwill be a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits, and\nMr. Elton’s time is so engaged.”',
			'“Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.—He really is engaged from morning\nto night.—There is no end of people’s coming to him, on some\npretence or other.—The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens, are\nalways wanting his opinion. They seem not able to do any thing without\nhim.—‘Upon my word, Mr. E.,’ I often say, ‘rather you\nthan I.—I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument,\nif I had half so many applicants.’—Bad enough as it is, for I\nabsolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.—I believe I have\nnot played a bar this fortnight.—However, he is coming, I assure you:\nyes, indeed, on purpose to wait on you all.” And putting up her hand to\nscreen her words from Emma—“A congratulatory visit, you\nknow.—Oh! yes, quite indispensable.”',
			'Miss Bates looked about her, so happily—!',
			'“He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from\nKnightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep\nconsultation.—Mr. E. is Knightley’s right hand.”',
			'Emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, “Is Mr. Elton\ngone on foot to Donwell?—He will have a hot walk.”',
			'“Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting. Weston and Cole\nwill be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead.—I\nfancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way.”',
			'“Have not you mistaken the day?” said Emma. “I am almost\ncertain that the meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.—Mr.\nKnightley was at Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.”',
			'“Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day,” was the abrupt answer,\nwhich denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton’s\nside.—“I do believe,” she continued, “this is the most\ntroublesome parish that ever was. We never heard of such things at Maple\nGrove.”',
			'“Your parish there was small,” said Jane.',
			'“Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject\ntalked of.”',
			'“But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard you\nspeak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge; the only\nschool, and not more than five-and-twenty children.”',
			'“Ah! you clever creature, that’s very true. What a thinking brain\nyou have! I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make, if we\ncould be shaken together. My liveliness and your solidity would produce\nperfection.—Not that I presume to insinuate, however, that some\npeople may not think you perfection already.—But hush!—not a\nword, if you please.”',
			'It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words, not to\nMrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw. The wish of\ndistinguishing her, as far as civility permitted, was very evident, though it\ncould not often proceed beyond a look.',
			'Mr. Elton made his appearance. His lady greeted him with some of her sparkling\nvivacity.',
			'“Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an encumbrance\nto my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!—But you knew what a\ndutiful creature you had to deal with. You knew I should not stir till my lord\nand master appeared.—Here have I been sitting this hour, giving these\nyoung ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience—for who can say, you\nknow, how soon it may be wanted?”',
			'Mr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away. His\ncivilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent object was to\nlament over himself for the heat he was suffering, and the walk he had had for\nnothing.',
			'“When I got to Donwell,” said he, “Knightley could not be\nfound. Very odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning,\nand the message he returned, that he should certainly be at home till\none.”',
			'“Donwell!” cried his wife.—“My dear Mr. E., you have\nnot been to Donwell!—You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the\nCrown.”',
			'“No, no, that’s to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see\nKnightley to-day on that very account.—Such a dreadful broiling\nmorning!—I went over the fields too—(speaking in a tone of great\nill-usage,) which made it so much the worse. And then not to find him at home!\nI assure you I am not at all pleased. And no apology left, no message for me.\nThe housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.—Very\nextraordinary!—And nobody knew at all which way he was gone. Perhaps to\nHartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.—Miss\nWoodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!—Can you explain\nit?”',
			'Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary, indeed, and\nthat she had not a syllable to say for him.',
			'“I cannot imagine,” said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a\nwife ought to do,) “I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you,\nof all people in the world! The very last person whom one should expect to be\nforgotten!—My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you, I am sure\nhe must.—Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;—and his\nservants forgot it. Depend upon it, that was the case: and very likely to\nhappen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often observed, extremely\nawkward and remiss.—I am sure I would not have such a creature as his\nHarry stand at our sideboard for any consideration. And as for Mrs. Hodges,\nWright holds her very cheap indeed.—She promised Wright a receipt, and\nnever sent it.”',
			'“I met William Larkins,” continued Mr. Elton, “as I got near\nthe house, and he told me I should not find his master at home, but I did not\nbelieve him.—William seemed rather out of humour. He did not know what\nwas come to his master lately, he said, but he could hardly ever get the speech\nof him. I have nothing to do with William’s wants, but it really is of\nvery great importance that I should see Knightley to-day; and it becomes\na matter, therefore, of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this\nhot walk to no purpose.”',
			'Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly. In all\nprobability she was at this very time waited for there; and Mr. Knightley might\nbe preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards Mr. Elton, if not\ntowards William Larkins.',
			'She was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined to attend her\nout of the room, to go with her even downstairs; it gave her an opportunity\nwhich she immediately made use of, to say,',
			'“It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility. Had you not\nbeen surrounded by other friends, I might have been tempted to introduce a\nsubject, to ask questions, to speak more openly than might have been strictly\ncorrect.—I feel that I should certainly have been impertinent.”',
			'“Oh!” cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought\ninfinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual\ncomposure—“there would have been no danger. The danger would have\nbeen of my wearying you. You could not have gratified me more than by\nexpressing an interest—. Indeed, Miss Woodhouse, (speaking more\ncollectedly,) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct, very great\nmisconduct, it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my\nfriends, whose good opinion is most worth preserving, are not disgusted to such\na degree as to—I have not time for half that I could wish to say. I long\nto make apologies, excuses, to urge something for myself. I feel it so very\ndue. But, unfortunately—in short, if your compassion does not stand my\nfriend—”',
			'“Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,” cried Emma warmly,\nand taking her hand. “You owe me no apologies; and every body to whom you\nmight be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied, so delighted\neven—”',
			'“You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.—So cold\nand artificial!—I had always a part to act.—It was a life of\ndeceit!—I know that I must have disgusted you.”',
			'“Pray say no more. I feel that all the apologies should be on my side.\nLet us forgive each other at once. We must do whatever is to be done quickest,\nand I think our feelings will lose no time there. I hope you have pleasant\naccounts from Windsor?”',
			'“Very.”',
			'“And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose\nyou—just as I begin to know you.”',
			'“Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. I am here\ntill claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.”',
			'“Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps,” replied Emma,\nsmiling—“but, excuse me, it must be thought of.”',
			'The smile was returned as Jane answered,',
			'“You are very right; it has been thought of. And I will own to you, (I am\nsure it will be safe), that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill at\nEnscombe, it is settled. There must be three months, at least, of deep\nmourning; but when they are over, I imagine there will be nothing more to wait\nfor.”',
			'“Thank you, thank you.—This is just what I wanted to be assured\nof.—Oh! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and\nopen!—Good-bye, good-bye.”',

		[
			'Mrs. Weston’s friends were all made happy by her safety; and if the\nsatisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to Emma, it was by knowing\nher to be the mother of a little girl. She had been decided in wishing for a\nMiss Weston. She would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a\nmatch for her, hereafter, with either of Isabella’s sons; but she was\nconvinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best. It would be a\ngreat comfort to Mr. Weston, as he grew older—and even Mr. Weston might\nbe growing older ten years hence—to have his fireside enlivened by the\nsports and the nonsense, the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished\nfrom home; and Mrs. Weston—no one could doubt that a daughter would be\nmost to her; and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to\nteach, should not have their powers in exercise again.',
			'“She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,” she\ncontinued—“like La Baronne d’Almane on La Comtesse\nd’Ostalis, in Madame de Genlis’ Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall\nnow see her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan.”',
			'“That is,” replied Mr. Knightley, “she will indulge her even\nmore than she did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all. It\nwill be the only difference.”',
			'“Poor child!” cried Emma; “at that rate, what will become of\nher?”',
			'“Nothing very bad.—The fate of thousands. She will be disagreeable\nin infancy, and correct herself as she grows older. I am losing all my\nbitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma. I, who am owing all my\nhappiness to you, would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be\nsevere on them?”',
			'Emma laughed, and replied: “But I had the assistance of all your\nendeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people. I doubt whether my own\nsense would have corrected me without it.”',
			'“Do you?—I have no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:—Miss\nTaylor gave you principles. You must have done well. My interference was quite\nas likely to do harm as good. It was very natural for you to say, what right\nhas he to lecture me?—and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that\nit was done in a disagreeable manner. I do not believe I did you any good. The\ngood was all to myself, by making you an object of the tenderest affection to\nme. I could not think about you so much without doating on you, faults and all;\nand by dint of fancying so many errors, have been in love with you ever since\nyou were thirteen at least.”',
			'“I am sure you were of use to me,” cried Emma. “I was very\noften influenced rightly by you—oftener than I would own at the time. I\nam very sure you did me good. And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled,\nit will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done\nfor me, except falling in love with her when she is thirteen.”',
			'“How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one of your\nsaucy looks—‘Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; papa says I\nmay, or I have Miss Taylor’s leave’—something which, you\nknew, I did not approve. In such cases my interference was giving you two bad\nfeelings instead of one.”',
			'“What an amiable creature I was!—No wonder you should hold my\nspeeches in such affectionate remembrance.”',
			'“‘Mr. Knightley.’—You always called me, ‘Mr.\nKnightley;’ and, from habit, it has not so very formal a sound.—And\nyet it is formal. I want you to call me something else, but I do not know\nwhat.”',
			'“I remember once calling you ‘George,’ in one of my amiable\nfits, about ten years ago. I did it because I thought it would offend you; but,\nas you made no objection, I never did it again.”',
			'“And cannot you call me ‘George’ now?”',
			'“Impossible!—I never can call you any thing but ‘Mr.\nKnightley.’ I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of\nMrs. Elton, by calling you Mr. K.—But I will promise,” she added\npresently, laughing and blushing—“I will promise to call you once\nby your Christian name. I do not say when, but perhaps you may guess\nwhere;—in the building in which N. takes M. for better, for worse.”',
			'Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service\nwhich his better sense would have rendered her, to the advice which would have\nsaved her from the worst of all her womanly follies—her wilful intimacy\nwith Harriet Smith; but it was too tender a subject.—She could not enter\non it.—Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them. This, on his side,\nmight merely proceed from her not being thought of; but Emma was rather\ninclined to attribute it to delicacy, and a suspicion, from some appearances,\nthat their friendship were declining. She was aware herself, that, parting\nunder any other circumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more,\nand that her intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did,\non Isabella’s letters. He might observe that it was so. The pain of being\nobliged to practise concealment towards him, was very little inferior to the\npain of having made Harriet unhappy.',
			'Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected; on\nher first arrival she had thought her out of spirits, which appeared perfectly\nnatural, as there was a dentist to be consulted; but, since that business had\nbeen over, she did not appear to find Harriet different from what she had known\nher before.—Isabella, to be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if\nHarriet had not been equal to playing with the children, it would not have\nescaped her. Emma’s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on, by\nHarriet’s being to stay longer; her fortnight was likely to be a month at\nleast. Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down in August, and she was\ninvited to remain till they could bring her back.',
			'“John does not even mention your friend,” said Mr. Knightley.\n“Here is his answer, if you like to see it.”',
			'It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage. Emma accepted\nit with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive to know what he would\nsay about it, and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was\nunmentioned.',
			'“John enters like a brother into my happiness,” continued Mr.\nKnightley, “but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him to\nhave, likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far from making\nflourishes, that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her\npraise. But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes.”',
			'“He writes like a sensible man,” replied Emma, when she had read\nthe letter. “I honour his sincerity. It is very plain that he considers\nthe good fortune of the engagement as all on my side, but that he is not\nwithout hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of your affection, as you think\nme already. Had he said any thing to bear a different construction, I should\nnot have believed him.”',
			'“My Emma, he means no such thing. He only means—”',
			'“He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,”\ninterrupted she, with a sort of serious smile—“much less, perhaps,\nthan he is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the\nsubject.”',
			'“Emma, my dear Emma—”',
			'“Oh!” she cried with more thorough gaiety, “if you fancy your\nbrother does not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in the secret,\nand hear his opinion. Depend upon it, he will be much farther from doing\nyou justice. He will think all the happiness, all the advantage, on your\nside of the question; all the merit on mine. I wish I may not sink into\n‘poor Emma’ with him at once.—His tender compassion towards\noppressed worth can go no farther.”',
			'“Ah!” he cried, “I wish your father might be half as easily\nconvinced as John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give,\nto be happy together. I am amused by one part of John’s letter—did\nyou notice it?—where he says, that my information did not take him wholly\nby surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the\nkind.”',
			'“If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your having some\nthoughts of marrying. He had no idea of me. He seems perfectly unprepared for\nthat.”',
			'“Yes, yes—but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my\nfeelings. What has he been judging by?—I am not conscious of any\ndifference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time\nfor my marrying any more than at another.—But it was so, I suppose. I\ndare say there was a difference when I was staying with them the other day. I\nbelieve I did not play with the children quite so much as usual. I remember one\nevening the poor boys saying, ‘Uncle seems always tired\nnow.’”',
			'The time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other persons’\nreception of it tried. As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently recovered to\nadmit Mr. Woodhouse’s visits, Emma having it in view that her gentle\nreasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved first to announce it at\nhome, and then at Randalls.—But how to break it to her father at\nlast!—She had bound herself to do it, in such an hour of Mr.\nKnightley’s absence, or when it came to the point her heart would have\nfailed her, and she must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such\na time, and follow up the beginning she was to make.—She was forced to\nspeak, and to speak cheerfully too. She must not make it a more decided subject\nof misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself. She must not appear to think it\na misfortune.—With all the spirits she could command, she prepared him\nfirst for something strange, and then, in a few words, said, that if his\nconsent and approbation could be obtained—which, she trusted, would be\nattended with no difficulty, since it was a plan to promote the happiness of\nall—she and Mr. Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield would\nreceive the constant addition of that person’s company whom she knew he\nloved, next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston, best in the world.',
			'Poor man!—it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he tried\nearnestly to dissuade her from it. She was reminded, more than once, of having\nalways said she would never marry, and assured that it would be a great deal\nbetter for her to remain single; and told of poor Isabella, and poor Miss\nTaylor.—But it would not do. Emma hung about him affectionately, and\nsmiled, and said it must be so; and that he must not class her with Isabella\nand Mrs. Weston, whose marriages taking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made\na melancholy change: but she was not going from Hartfield; she should be always\nthere; she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for\nthe better; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for\nhaving Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he were once got used to the\nidea.—Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?—He would not deny\nthat he did, she was sure.—Whom did he ever want to consult on business\nbut Mr. Knightley?—Who was so useful to him, who so ready to write his\nletters, who so glad to assist him?—Who so cheerful, so attentive, so\nattached to him?—Would not he like to have him always on the\nspot?—Yes. That was all very true. Mr. Knightley could not be there too\noften; he should be glad to see him every day;—but they did see him every\nday as it was.—Why could not they go on as they had done?',
			'Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome, the\nidea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.—To\nEmma’s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley’s, whose\nfond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he was soon\nused to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.—They had all the\nassistance which Isabella could give, by letters of the strongest approbation;\nand Mrs. Weston was ready, on the first meeting, to consider the subject in the\nmost serviceable light—first, as a settled, and, secondly, as a good\none—well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations\nto Mr. Woodhouse’s mind.—It was agreed upon, as what was to be; and\nevery body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for\nhis happiness; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it, he\nbegan to think that some time or other—in another year or two,\nperhaps—it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place.',
			'Mrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she said to\nhim in favour of the event.—She had been extremely surprized, never more\nso, than when Emma first opened the affair to her; but she saw in it only\nincrease of happiness to all, and had no scruple in urging him to the\nutmost.—She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, as to think he deserved\neven her dearest Emma; and it was in every respect so proper, suitable, and\nunexceptionable a connexion, and in one respect, one point of the highest\nimportance, so peculiarly eligible, so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed\nas if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature, and\nthat she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it,\nand wished it long ago.—How very few of those men in a rank of life to\naddress Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr.\nKnightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an\narrangement desirable!—The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse\nhad been always felt in her husband’s plans and her own, for a marriage\nbetween Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had\nbeen a continual impediment—less acknowledged by Mr. Weston than by\nherself—but even he had never been able to finish the subject better than\nby saying—“Those matters will take care of themselves; the young\npeople will find a way.” But here there was nothing to be shifted off in\na wild speculation on the future. It was all right, all open, all equal. No\nsacrifice on any side worth the name. It was a union of the highest promise of\nfelicity in itself, and without one real, rational difficulty to oppose or\ndelay it.',
			'Mrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections as these,\nwas one of the happiest women in the world. If any thing could increase her\ndelight, it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set\nof caps.',
			'The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr. Weston had his\nfive minutes share of it; but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea\nto his quickness of mind.—He saw the advantages of the match, and\nrejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife; but the wonder of it was\nvery soon nothing; and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that\nhe had always foreseen it.',
			'“It is to be a secret, I conclude,” said he. “These matters\nare always a secret, till it is found out that every body knows them. Only let\nme be told when I may speak out.—I wonder whether Jane has any\nsuspicion.”',
			'He went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on that point. He\ntold her the news. Was not she like a daughter, his eldest daughter?—he\nmust tell her; and Miss Bates being present, it passed, of course, to Mrs.\nCole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, immediately afterwards. It was no more than\nthe principals were prepared for; they had calculated from the time of its\nbeing known at Randalls, how soon it would be over Highbury; and were thinking\nof themselves, as the evening wonder in many a family circle, with great\nsagacity.',
			'In general, it was a very well approved match. Some might think him, and others\nmight think her, the most in luck. One set might recommend their all removing\nto Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys; and another might\npredict disagreements among their servants; but yet, upon the whole, there was\nno serious objection raised, except in one habitation, the\nVicarage.—There, the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction. Mr.\nElton cared little about it, compared with his wife; he only hoped “the\nyoung lady’s pride would now be contented;” and supposed “she\nhad always meant to catch Knightley if she could;” and, on the point of\nliving at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, “Rather he than\nI!”—But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed\nindeed.—“Poor Knightley! poor fellow!—sad business for\nhim.”—She was extremely concerned; for, though very eccentric, he\nhad a thousand good qualities.—How could he be so taken in?—Did not\nthink him at all in love—not in the least.—Poor\nKnightley!—There would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with\nhim.—How happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked\nhim! But that would be all over now.—Poor fellow!—No more exploring\nparties to Donwell made for her. Oh! no; there would be a Mrs. Knightley\nto throw cold water on every thing.—Extremely disagreeable! But she was\nnot at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other\nday.—Shocking plan, living together. It would never do. She knew a family\nnear Maple Grove who had tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end\nof the first quarter.',

		[
			'Time passed on. A few more to-morrows, and the party from London would be\narriving. It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking of it one morning,\nas what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her, when Mr. Knightley\ncame in, and distressing thoughts were put by. After the first chat of pleasure\nhe was silent; and then, in a graver tone, began with,',
			'“I have something to tell you, Emma; some news.”',
			'“Good or bad?” said she, quickly, looking up in his face.',
			'“I do not know which it ought to be called.”',
			'“Oh! good I am sure.—I see it in your countenance. You are trying\nnot to smile.”',
			'“I am afraid,” said he, composing his features, “I am very\nmuch afraid, my dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it.”',
			'“Indeed! but why so?—I can hardly imagine that any thing which\npleases or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.”',
			'“There is one subject,” he replied, “I hope but one, on which\nwe do not think alike.” He paused a moment, again smiling, with his eyes\nfixed on her face. “Does nothing occur to you?—Do not you\nrecollect?—Harriet Smith.”',
			'Her cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something, though she\nknew not what.',
			'“Have you heard from her yourself this morning?” cried he.\n“You have, I believe, and know the whole.”',
			'“No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me.”',
			'“You are prepared for the worst, I see—and very bad it is. Harriet\nSmith marries Robert Martin.”',
			'Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared—and her eyes,\nin eager gaze, said, “No, this is impossible!” but her lips were\nclosed.',
			'“It is so, indeed,” continued Mr. Knightley; “I have it from\nRobert Martin himself. He left me not half an hour ago.”',
			'She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.',
			'“You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.—I wish our opinions\nwere the same. But in time they will. Time, you may be sure, will make one or\nthe other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile, we need not talk much\non the subject.”',
			'“You mistake me, you quite mistake me,” she replied, exerting\nherself. “It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy,\nbut I cannot believe it. It seems an impossibility!—You cannot mean to\nsay, that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin. You cannot mean that he has\neven proposed to her again—yet. You only mean, that he intends it.”',
			'“I mean that he has done it,” answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling\nbut determined decision, “and been accepted.”',
			'“Good God!” she cried.—“Well!”—Then having\nrecourse to her workbasket, in excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing\nall the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must\nbe expressing, she added, “Well, now tell me every thing; make this\nintelligible to me. How, where, when?—Let me know it all. I never was\nmore surprized—but it does not make me unhappy, I assure\nyou.—How—how has it been possible?”',
			'“It is a very simple story. He went to town on business three days ago,\nand I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send to\nJohn.—He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers, and was asked\nby him to join their party the same evening to Astley’s. They were going\nto take the two eldest boys to Astley’s. The party was to be our brother\nand sister, Henry, John—and Miss Smith. My friend Robert could not\nresist. They called for him in their way; were all extremely amused; and my\nbrother asked him to dine with them the next day—which he did—and\nin the course of that visit (as I understand) he found an opportunity of\nspeaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak in vain.—She made him,\nby her acceptance, as happy even as he is deserving. He came down by\nyesterday’s coach, and was with me this morning immediately after\nbreakfast, to report his proceedings, first on my affairs, and then on his own.\nThis is all that I can relate of the how, where, and when. Your friend Harriet\nwill make a much longer history when you see her.—She will give you all\nthe minute particulars, which only woman’s language can make\ninteresting.—In our communications we deal only in the\ngreat.—However, I must say, that Robert Martin’s heart seemed for\nhim, and to me, very overflowing; and that he did mention,\nwithout its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their box at\nAstley’s, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and little John,\nand he followed with Miss Smith and Henry; and that at one time they were in\nsuch a crowd, as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy.”',
			'He stopped.—Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply. To speak, she was\nsure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness. She must wait\na moment, or he would think her mad. Her silence disturbed him; and after\nobserving her a little while, he added,',
			'“Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make you\nunhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected. His\nsituation is an evil—but you must consider it as what satisfies your\nfriend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you\nknow him more. His good sense and good principles would delight you.—As\nfar as the man is concerned, you could not wish your friend in better hands.\nHis rank in society I would alter if I could, which is saying a great deal I\nassure you, Emma.—You laugh at me about William Larkins; but I could\nquite as ill spare Robert Martin.”',
			'He wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not to smile\ntoo broadly—she did—cheerfully answering,',
			'“You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. I think\nHarriet is doing extremely well. Her connexions may be worse than\nhis. In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they\nare. I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. You cannot\nimagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly unprepared I\nwas!—for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined against\nhim, much more, than she was before.”',
			'“You ought to know your friend best,” replied Mr. Knightley;\n“but I should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely\nto be very, very determined against any young man who told her he loved\nher.”',
			'Emma could not help laughing as she answered, “Upon my word, I believe\nyou know her quite as well as I do.—But, Mr. Knightley, are you perfectly\nsure that she has absolutely and downright accepted him. I could suppose\nshe might in time—but can she already?—Did not you misunderstand\nhim?—You were both talking of other things; of business, shows of cattle,\nor new drills—and might not you, in the confusion of so many subjects,\nmistake him?—It was not Harriet’s hand that he was certain\nof—it was the dimensions of some famous ox.”',
			'The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert Martin\nwas, at this moment, so strong to Emma’s feelings, and so strong was the\nrecollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet’s side, so\nfresh the sound of those words, spoken with such emphasis, “No, I hope I\nknow better than to think of Robert Martin,” that she was really\nexpecting the intelligence to prove, in some measure, premature. It could not\nbe otherwise.',
			'“Do you dare say this?” cried Mr. Knightley. “Do you dare to\nsuppose me so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking\nof?—What do you deserve?”',
			'“Oh! I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with any\nother; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer. Are you quite\nsure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and Harriet now\nare?”',
			'“I am quite sure,” he replied, speaking very distinctly,\n“that he told me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity,\nnothing doubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you a proof that\nit must be so. He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do. He knew of no\none but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or\nfriends. Could I mention any thing more fit to be done, than to go to Mrs.\nGoddard? I assured him that I could not. Then, he said, he would endeavour to\nsee her in the course of this day.”',
			'“I am perfectly satisfied,” replied Emma, with the brightest\nsmiles, “and most sincerely wish them happy.”',
			'“You are materially changed since we talked on this subject\nbefore.”',
			'“I hope so—for at that time I was a fool.”',
			'“And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all\nHarriet’s good qualities. I have taken some pains for your sake, and for\nRobert Martin’s sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe as much\nin love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her. I have often talked to\nher a good deal. You must have seen that I did. Sometimes, indeed, I have\nthought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Martin’s cause,\nwhich was never the case; but, from all my observations, I am convinced of her\nbeing an artless, amiable girl, with very good notions, very seriously good\nprinciples, and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic\nlife.—Much of this, I have no doubt, she may thank you for.”',
			'“Me!” cried Emma, shaking her head.—“Ah! poor\nHarriet!”',
			'She checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little more praise\nthan she deserved.',
			'Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father.\nShe was not sorry. She wanted to be alone. Her mind was in a state of flutter\nand wonder, which made it impossible for her to be collected. She was in\ndancing, singing, exclaiming spirits; and till she had moved about, and talked\nto herself, and laughed and reflected, she could be fit for nothing rational.',
			'Her father’s business was to announce James’s being gone out to put\nthe horses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls; and she had,\ntherefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.',
			'The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations may be\nimagined. The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of\nHarriet’s welfare, she was really in danger of becoming too happy for\nsecurity.—What had she to wish for? Nothing, but to grow more worthy of\nhim, whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own.\nNothing, but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and\ncircumspection in future.',
			'Serious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her resolutions; and\nyet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the very midst of them. She\nmust laugh at such a close! Such an end of the doleful disappointment of five\nweeks back! Such a heart—such a Harriet!',
			'Now there would be pleasure in her returning—Every thing would be a\npleasure. It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.',
			'High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities, was the\nreflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would soon be\nover. The disguise, equivocation, mystery, so hateful to her to practise, might\nsoon be over. She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect\nconfidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty.',
			'In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father; not always\nlistening, but always agreeing to what he said; and, whether in speech or\nsilence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to\nRandalls every day, or poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed.',
			'They arrived.—Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:—but hardly\nhad they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks for\ncoming, which he asked for, when a glimpse was caught through the blind, of two\nfigures passing near the window.',
			'“It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,” said Mrs. Weston. “I was just\ngoing to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning.\nHe stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day\nwith us.—They are coming in, I hope.”',
			'In half a minute they were in the room. Emma was extremely glad to see\nhim—but there was a degree of confusion—a number of embarrassing\nrecollections on each side. They met readily and smiling, but with a\nconsciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having all sat down\nagain, there was for some time such a blank in the circle, that Emma began to\ndoubt whether the wish now indulged, which she had long felt, of seeing Frank\nChurchill once more, and of seeing him with Jane, would yield its proportion of\npleasure. When Mr. Weston joined the party, however, and when the baby was\nfetched, there was no longer a want of subject or animation—or of courage\nand opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her and say,',
			'“I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving message\nin one of Mrs. Weston’s letters. I hope time has not made you less\nwilling to pardon. I hope you do not retract what you then said.”',
			'“No, indeed,” cried Emma, most happy to begin, “not in the\nleast. I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you—and to give\nyou joy in person.”',
			'He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak with\nserious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.',
			'“Is not she looking well?” said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.\n“Better than she ever used to do?—You see how my father and Mrs.\nWeston doat upon her.”',
			'But his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes, after\nmentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named the name of\nDixon.—Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing.',
			'“I can never think of it,” she cried, “without extreme\nshame.”',
			'“The shame,” he answered, “is all mine, or ought to be. But\nis it possible that you had no suspicion?—I mean of late. Early, I know,\nyou had none.”',
			'“I never had the smallest, I assure you.”',
			'“That appears quite wonderful. I was once very near—and I wish I\nhad—it would have been better. But though I was always doing wrong\nthings, they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no\nservice.—It would have been a much better transgression had I broken the\nbond of secrecy and told you every thing.”',
			'“It is not now worth a regret,” said Emma.',
			'“I have some hope,” resumed he, “of my uncle’s being\npersuaded to pay a visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her. When\nthe Campbells are returned, we shall meet them in London, and continue there, I\ntrust, till we may carry her northward.—But now, I am at such a distance\nfrom her—is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?—Till this morning, we have\nnot once met since the day of reconciliation. Do not you pity me?”',
			'Emma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession of gay\nthought, he cried,',
			'“Ah! by the bye,” then sinking his voice, and looking demure for\nthe moment—“I hope Mr. Knightley is well?” He\npaused.—She coloured and laughed.—“I know you saw my letter,\nand think you may remember my wish in your favour. Let me return your\ncongratulations.—I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest\ninterest and satisfaction.—He is a man whom I cannot presume to\npraise.”',
			'Emma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style; but his\nmind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane, and his\nnext words were,',
			'“Did you ever see such a skin?—such smoothness! such\ndelicacy!—and yet without being actually fair.—One cannot call her\nfair. It is a most uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and\nhair—a most distinguishing complexion! So peculiarly the lady in\nit.—Just colour enough for beauty.”',
			'“I have always admired her complexion,” replied Emma, archly;\n“but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being\nso pale?—When we first began to talk of her.—Have you quite\nforgotten?”',
			'“Oh! no—what an impudent dog I was!—How could I\ndare—”',
			'But he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could not help\nsaying,',
			'“I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time, you\nhad very great amusement in tricking us all.—I am sure you had.—I\nam sure it was a consolation to you.”',
			'“Oh! no, no, no—how can you suspect me of such a thing? I was the\nmost miserable wretch!”',
			'“Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth. I am sure it was a\nsource of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking us all\nin.—Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell you the truth,\nI think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation. I\nthink there is a little likeness between us.”',
			'He bowed.',
			'“If not in our dispositions,” she presently added, with a look of\ntrue sensibility, “there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny which\nbids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own.”',
			'“True, true,” he answered, warmly. “No, not true on your\nside. You can have no superior, but most true on mine.—She is a complete\nangel. Look at her. Is not she an angel in every gesture? Observe the turn of\nher throat. Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.—You will\nbe glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously) that my uncle\nmeans to give her all my aunt’s jewels. They are to be new set. I am\nresolved to have some in an ornament for the head. Will not it be beautiful in\nher dark hair?”',
			'“Very beautiful, indeed,” replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly,\nthat he gratefully burst out,',
			'“How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such excellent\nlooks!—I would not have missed this meeting for the world. I should\ncertainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come.”',
			'The others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an account of a\nlittle alarm she had been under, the evening before, from the infant’s\nappearing not quite well. She believed she had been foolish, but it had alarmed\nher, and she had been within half a minute of sending for Mr. Perry. Perhaps\nshe ought to be ashamed, but Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as\nherself.—In ten minutes, however, the child had been perfectly well\nagain. This was her history; and particularly interesting it was to Mr.\nWoodhouse, who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry, and\nonly regretted that she had not done it. “She should always send for\nPerry, if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered, were it only\nfor a moment. She could not be too soon alarmed, nor send for Perry too often.\nIt was a pity, perhaps, that he had not come last night; for, though the child\nseemed well now, very well considering, it would probably have been better if\nPerry had seen it.”',
			'Frank Churchill caught the name.',
			'“Perry!” said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch Miss\nFairfax’s eye. “My friend Mr. Perry! What are they saying about Mr.\nPerry?—Has he been here this morning?—And how does he travel\nnow?—Has he set up his carriage?”',
			'Emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined in the laugh,\nit was evident from Jane’s countenance that she too was really hearing\nhim, though trying to seem deaf.',
			'“Such an extraordinary dream of mine!” he cried. “I can never\nthink of it without laughing.—She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse.\nI see it in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown. Look at her. Do\nnot you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her own letter, which\nsent me the report, is passing under her eye—that the whole blunder is\nspread before her—that she can attend to nothing else, though pretending\nto listen to the others?”',
			'Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile partly\nremained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious, low, yet steady\nvoice,',
			'“How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!—They\nwill sometimes obtrude—but how you can court them!”',
			'He had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly; but Emma’s\nfeelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on leaving Randalls, and\nfalling naturally into a comparison of the two men, she felt, that pleased as\nshe had been to see Frank Churchill, and really regarding him as she did with\nfriendship, she had never been more sensible of Mr. Knightley’s high\nsuperiority of character. The happiness of this most happy day, received its\ncompletion, in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison\nproduced.',

		[
			'If Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet, a momentary\ndoubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to Mr.\nKnightley, and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination, it\nwas not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such\nuncertainty. A very few days brought the party from London, and she had no\nsooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet, than she became\nperfectly satisfied—unaccountable as it was!—that Robert Martin had\nthoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley, and was now forming all her views of\nhappiness.',
			'Harriet was a little distressed—did look a little foolish at first: but\nhaving once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly, and self-deceived,\nbefore, her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words, and leave her\nwithout a care for the past, and with the fullest exultation in the present and\nfuture; for, as to her friend’s approbation, Emma had instantly removed\nevery fear of that nature, by meeting her with the most unqualified\ncongratulations.—Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the\nevening at Astley’s, and the dinner the next day; she could dwell on it\nall with the utmost delight. But what did such particulars explain?—The\nfact was, as Emma could now acknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert\nMartin; and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible.—Beyond\nthis, it must ever be unintelligible to Emma.',
			'The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her fresh reason\nfor thinking so.—Harriet’s parentage became known. She proved to be\nthe daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her the comfortable\nmaintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough to have always wished\nfor concealment.—Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly\nbeen so ready to vouch for!—It was likely to be as untainted, perhaps, as\nthe blood of many a gentleman: but what a connexion had she been preparing for\nMr. Knightley—or for the Churchills—or even for Mr.\nElton!—The stain of illegitimacy, unbleached by nobility or wealth, would\nhave been a stain indeed.',
			'No objection was raised on the father’s side; the young man was treated\nliberally; it was all as it should be: and as Emma became acquainted with\nRobert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield, she fully acknowledged in\nhim all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her\nlittle friend. She had no doubt of Harriet’s happiness with any\ngood-tempered man; but with him, and in the home he offered, there would be the\nhope of more, of security, stability, and improvement. She would be placed in\nthe midst of those who loved her, and who had better sense than herself;\nretired enough for safety, and occupied enough for cheerfulness. She would be\nnever led into temptation, nor left for it to find her out. She would be\nrespectable and happy; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the\nworld, to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a\nman;—or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself.',
			'Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins, was less\nand less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.—The intimacy\nbetween her and Emma must sink; their friendship must change into a calmer sort\nof goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be, and must be, seemed already\nbeginning, and in the most gradual, natural manner.',
			'Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw her hand\nbestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction, as no remembrances,\neven connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them, could\nimpair.—Perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw Mr. Elton, but as\nthe clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on\nherself.—Robert Martin and Harriet Smith, the latest couple engaged of\nthe three, were the first to be married.',
			'Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the comforts of\nher beloved home with the Campbells.—The Mr. Churchills were also in\ntown; and they were only waiting for November.',
			'The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared, by Emma and\nMr. Knightley.—They had determined that their marriage ought to be\nconcluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield, to allow them the\nfortnight’s absence in a tour to the seaside, which was the\nplan.—John and Isabella, and every other friend, were agreed in approving\nit. But Mr. Woodhouse—how was Mr. Woodhouse to be induced to\nconsent?—he, who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant\nevent.',
			'When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they were almost\nhopeless.—A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.—He began to\nthink it was to be, and that he could not prevent it—a very promising\nstep of the mind on its way to resignation. Still, however, he was not happy.\nNay, he appeared so much otherwise, that his daughter’s courage failed.\nShe could not bear to see him suffering, to know him fancying himself\nneglected; and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of\nboth the Mr. Knightleys, that when once the event were over, his distress would\nbe soon over too, she hesitated—she could not proceed.',
			'In this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden illumination\nof Mr. Woodhouse’s mind, or any wonderful change of his nervous system,\nbut by the operation of the same system in another way.—Mrs.\nWeston’s poultry-house was robbed one night of all her\nturkeys—evidently by the ingenuity of man. Other poultry-yards in the\nneighbourhood also suffered.—Pilfering was housebreaking to Mr.\nWoodhouse’s fears.—He was very uneasy; and but for the sense of his\nson-in-law’s protection, would have been under wretched alarm every night\nof his life. The strength, resolution, and presence of mind of the Mr.\nKnightleys, commanded his fullest dependence. While either of them protected\nhim and his, Hartfield was safe.—But Mr. John Knightley must be in London\nagain by the end of the first week in November.',
			'The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary, cheerful\nconsent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment, she was\nable to fix her wedding-day—and Mr. Elton was called on, within a month\nfrom the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin, to join the hands of Mr.\nKnightley and Miss Woodhouse.',
			'The wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties have no taste\nfor finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the particulars detailed by her\nhusband, thought it all extremely shabby, and very inferior to her\nown.—“Very little white satin, very few lace veils; a most pitiful\nbusiness!—Selina would stare when she heard of it.”—But, in\nspite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, the confidence, the\npredictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony, were\nfully answered in the perfect happiness of the union.',
