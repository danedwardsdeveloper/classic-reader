			title: "Canon Alberic's Scrap-book",
			content: [
				'St Bertrand de Comminges is a decayed town on the spurs of the Pyrenees, not\nvery far from Toulouse, and still nearer to Bagnères-de-Luchon. It was the site\nof a bishopric until the Revolution, and has a cathedral which is visited by a\ncertain number of tourists. In the spring of 1883 an Englishman arrived at this\nold-world place—I can hardly dignify it with the name of city, for there\nare not a thousand inhabitants. He was a Cambridge man, who had come specially\nfrom Toulouse to see St Bertrand’s Church, and had left two friends, who\nwere less keen archaeologists than himself, in their hotel at Toulouse, under\npromise to join him on the following morning. Half an hour at the church would\nsatisfy them, and all three could then pursue their journey in the\ndirection of Auch. But our Englishman had come early on the day in question,\nand proposed to himself to fill a note-book and to use several dozens of plates\nin the process of describing and photographing every corner of the wonderful\nchurch that dominates the little hill of Comminges. In order to carry out this\ndesign satisfactorily, it was necessary to monopolize the verger of the church\nfor the day. The verger or sacristan (I prefer the latter appellation,\ninaccurate as it may be) was accordingly sent for by the somewhat brusque lady\nwho keeps the inn of the Chapeau Rouge; and when he came, the Englishman found\nhim an unexpectedly interesting object of study. It was not in the personal\nappearance of the little, dry, wizened old man that the interest lay, for he\nwas precisely like dozens of other church-guardians in France, but in a curious\nfurtive, or rather hunted and oppressed, air which he had. He was perpetually\nhalf glancing behind him; the muscles of his back and shoulders seemed to be\nhunched in a continual nervous contraction, as if he were expecting every\nmoment to find himself in the clutch of an enemy. The Englishman hardly knew\nwhether to put him down as a man haunted by a fixed delusion, or as one\noppressed by a guilty conscience, or as an unbearably henpecked husband. The\nprobabilities, when reckoned up, certainly pointed to the last idea; but,\nstill, the impression conveyed was that of a more formidable persecutor even\nthan a termagant wife.',
				'However, the Englishman (let us call him Dennistoun) was soon too deep in his\nnote-book and too busy with his camera to give more than an occasional glance\nto the sacristan. Whenever he did look at him, he found him at no great\ndistance, either huddling himself back against the wall or crouching in one of\nthe gorgeous stalls. Dennistoun became rather fidgety after a time. Mingled\nsuspicions that he was keeping the old man from his déjeuner, that he\nwas regarded as likely to make away with St Bertrand’s ivory crozier, or\nwith the dusty stuffed crocodile that hangs over the font, began to torment\nhim.',
				'“Won’t you go home?” he said at last; “I’m quite\nwell able to finish my notes alone; you can lock me in if you like. I shall\nwant at least two hours more here, and it must be cold for you, isn’t\nit?”',
				'“Good heavens!” said the little man, whom the suggestion seemed to\nthrow into a state of unaccountable terror, “such a thing cannot be\nthought of for a moment. Leave monsieur alone in the church? No, no; two hours,\nthree hours, all will be the same to me. I have breakfasted, I am not at all\ncold, with many thanks to monsieur.”',
				'“Very well, my little man,” quoth Dennistoun to himself: “you\nhave been warned, and you must take the consequences.”',
				'Before the expiration of the two hours, the stalls, the enormous dilapidated\norgan, the choir-screen of Bishop John de Mauléon, the remnants of glass and\ntapestry, and the objects in the treasure-chamber, had been well and truly\nexamined; the sacristan still keeping at Dennistoun’s heels, and every\nnow and then whipping round as if he had been stung, when one or other of the\nstrange noises that trouble a large empty building fell on his ear. Curious\nnoises they were sometimes.',
				'“Once,” Dennistoun said to me, “I could have sworn I heard a\nthin metallic voice laughing high up in the tower. I darted an inquiring glance\nat my sacristan. He was white to the lips. ‘It is he—that\nis—it is no one; the door is locked,’ was all he said, and we\nlooked at each other for a full minute.”',
				'Another little incident puzzled Dennistoun a good deal. He was examining a\nlarge dark picture that hangs behind the altar, one of a series illustrating\nthe miracles of St Bertrand. The composition of the picture is well-nigh\nindecipherable, but there is a Latin legend below, which runs thus:',
				'Qualiter S. Bertrandus liberavit hominem quem diabolus diu volebat\nstrangulare. (How St Bertrand delivered a man whom the Devil long sought to\nstrangle.)',
				'Dennistoun was turning to the sacristan with a smile and a jocular remark of\nsome sort on his lips, but he was confounded to see the old man on his knees,\ngazing at the picture with the eye of a suppliant in agony, his hands tightly\nclasped, and a rain of tears on his cheeks. Dennistoun naturally pretended to\nhave noticed nothing, but the question would not go away from him, “Why\nshould a daub of this kind affect anyone so strongly?” He seemed to\nhimself to be getting some sort of clue to the reason of the strange look that\nhad been puzzling him all the day: the man must be a monomaniac; but what was\nhis monomania?',
				'It was nearly five o’clock; the short day was drawing in, and the church\nbegan to fill with shadows, while the curious noises—the muffled\nfootfalls and distant talking voices that had been perceptible all\nday—seemed, no doubt because of the fading light and the consequently\nquickened sense of hearing, to become more frequent and insistent.',
				'The sacristan began for the first time to show signs of hurry and impatience.\nHe heaved a sigh of relief when camera and note-book were finally packed up and\nstowed away, and hurriedly beckoned Dennistoun to the western door of the\nchurch, under the tower. It was time to ring the Angelus. A few pulls at the\nreluctant rope, and the great bell Bertrande, high in the tower, began to\nspeak, and swung her voice up among the pines and down to the valleys, loud\nwith mountain-streams, calling the dwellers on those lonely hills to remember\nand repeat the salutation of the angel to her whom he called Blessed among\nwomen. With that a profound quiet seemed to fall for the first time that day\nupon the little town, and Dennistoun and the sacristan went out of the church.',
				'On the doorstep they fell into conversation.',
				'“Monsieur seemed to interest himself in the old choir-books in the\nsacristy.”',
				'“Undoubtedly. I was going to ask you if there were a library in the\ntown.”',
				'“No, monsieur; perhaps there used to be one belonging to the Chapter, but\nit is now such a small place—” Here came a strange pause of\nirresolution, as it seemed; then, with a sort of plunge, he went on: “But\nif monsieur is amateur des vieux livres, I have at home something that\nmight interest him. It is not a hundred yards.”',
				'At once all Dennistoun’s cherished dreams of finding priceless\nmanuscripts in untrodden corners of France flashed up, to die down again the\nnext moment. It was probably a stupid missal of Plantin’s printing, about\n1580. Where was the likelihood that a place so near Toulouse would not have\nbeen ransacked long ago by collectors? However, it would be foolish not to go;\nhe would reproach himself for ever after if he refused. So they set off. On the\nway the curious irresolution and sudden determination of the sacristan recurred\nto Dennistoun, and he wondered in a shamefaced way whether he was being decoyed\ninto some purlieu to be made away with as a supposed rich Englishman. He\ncontrived, therefore, to begin talking with his guide, and to drag in, in a\nrather clumsy fashion, the fact that he expected two friends to join him early\nthe next morning. To his surprise, the announcement seemed to relieve the\nsacristan at once of some of the anxiety that oppressed him.',
				'“That is well,” he said quite brightly—“that is very\nwell. Monsieur will travel in company with his friends; they will be always\nnear him. It is a good thing to travel thus in company—sometimes.”',
				'The last word appeared to be added as an afterthought and to bring with it a\nrelapse into gloom for the poor little man.',
				'They were soon at the house, which was one rather larger than its neighbours,\nstone-built, with a shield carved over the door, the shield of Alberic de\nMauléon, a collateral descendant, Dennistoun tells me, of Bishop John de\nMauléon. This Alberic was a Canon of Comminges from 1680 to 1701. The upper\nwindows of the mansion were boarded up, and the whole place bore, as does the\nrest of Comminges, the aspect of decaying age.',
				'Arrived on his doorstep, the sacristan paused a moment.',
				'“Perhaps,” he said, “perhaps, after all, monsieur has not the\ntime?”',
				'“Not at all—lots of time—nothing to do till tomorrow. Let us\nsee what it is you have got.”',
				'The door was opened at this point, and a face looked out, a face far younger\nthan the sacristan’s, but bearing something of the same distressing look:\nonly here it seemed to be the mark, not so much of fear for personal safety as\nof acute anxiety on behalf of another. Plainly, the owner of the face was the\nsacristan’s daughter; and, but for the expression I have described, she\nwas a handsome girl enough. She brightened up considerably on seeing her father\naccompanied by an able-bodied stranger. A few remarks passed between father and\ndaughter, of which Dennistoun only caught these words, said by the sacristan,\n“He was laughing in the church,” words which were answered only by\na look of terror from the girl.',
				'But in another minute they were in the sitting-room of the house, a small, high\nchamber with a stone floor, full of moving shadows cast by a wood-fire that\nflickered on a great hearth. Something of the character of an oratory was\nimparted to it by a tall crucifix, which reached almost to the ceiling on one\nside; the figure was painted of the natural colours, the cross was black. Under\nthis stood a chest of some age and solidity, and when a lamp had been brought,\nand chairs set, the sacristan went to this chest, and produced therefrom, with\ngrowing excitement and nervousness, as Dennistoun thought, a large book,\nwrapped in a white cloth, on which cloth a cross was rudely embroidered in red\nthread. Even before the wrapping had been removed, Dennistoun began to be\ninterested by the size and shape of the volume. “Too large for a\nmissal,” he thought, “and not the shape of an antiphoner; perhaps\nit may be something good, after all.” The next moment the book was open,\nand Dennistoun felt that he had at last lit upon something better than good.\nBefore him lay a large folio, bound, perhaps, late in the seventeenth century,\nwith the arms of Canon Alberic de Mauléon stamped in gold on the sides. There\nmay have been a hundred and fifty leaves of paper in the book, and on almost\nevery one of them was fastened a leaf from an illuminated manuscript. Such a\ncollection Dennistoun had hardly dreamed of in his wildest moments. Here were\nten leaves from a copy of Genesis, illustrated with pictures, which could not\nbe later than A.D. 700. Further on was a complete set of pictures from a\nPsalter, of English execution, of the very finest kind that the thirteenth\ncentury could produce; and, perhaps best of all, there were twenty leaves of\nuncial writing in Latin, which, as a few words seen here and there told him at\nonce, must belong to some very early unknown patristic treatise. Could it\npossibly be a fragment of the copy of Papias “On the Words of Our\nLord”, which was known to have existed as late as the twelfth century at\nNîmes?[1] In any\ncase, his mind was made up; that book must return to Cambridge with him, even\nif he had to draw the whole of his balance from the bank and stay at St.\nBertrand till the money came. He glanced up at the sacristan to see if his face\nyielded any hint that the book was for sale. The sacristan was pale, and his\nlips were working.',
				'[1]\nWe now know that these leaves did contain a considerable fragment of that work,\nif not of that actual copy of it.',
				'“If monsieur will turn on to the end,” he said.',
				'So monsieur turned on, meeting new treasures at every rise of a leaf; and at\nthe end of the book he came upon two sheets of paper, of much more recent date\nthan anything he had yet seen, which puzzled him considerably. They must be\ncontemporary, he decided, with the unprincipled Canon Alberic, who had\ndoubtless plundered the Chapter library of St Bertrand to form this priceless\nscrap-book. On the first of the paper sheets was a plan, carefully drawn and\ninstantly recognizable by a person who knew the ground, of the south aisle and\ncloisters of St Bertrand’s. There were curious signs looking like\nplanetary symbols, and a few Hebrew words in the corners; and in the north-west\nangle of the cloister was a cross drawn in gold paint. Below the plan were some\nlines of writing in Latin, which ran thus:',
				'Responsa 12mi Dec. 1694. Interrogatum est: Inveniamne? Responsum est:\nInvenies. Fiamne dives? Fies. Vivamne invidendus? Vives. Moriarne in lecto meo?\nIta. (Answers of the 12th of December, 1694. It was asked: Shall I find it?\nAnswer: Thou shalt. Shall I become rich? Thou wilt. Shall I live an object of\nenvy? Thou wilt. Shall I die in my bed? Thou wilt.)',
				'“A good specimen of the treasure-hunter’s record—quite\nreminds one of Mr Minor-Canon Quatremain in Old St Paul’s,”\nwas Dennistoun’s comment, and he turned the leaf.',
				'What he then saw impressed him, as he has often told me, more than he could\nhave conceived any drawing or picture capable of impressing him. And, though\nthe drawing he saw is no longer in existence, there is a photograph of it\n(which I possess) which fully bears out that statement. The picture in question\nwas a sepia drawing at the end of the seventeenth century, representing, one\nwould say at first sight, a Biblical scene; for the architecture (the picture\nrepresented an interior) and the figures had that semi-classical flavour about\nthem which the artists of two hundred years ago thought appropriate to\nillustrations of the Bible. On the right was a King on his throne, the throne\nelevated on twelve steps, a canopy overhead, soldiers on either\nside—evidently King Solomon. He was bending forward with outstretched\nsceptre, in attitude of command; his face expressed horror and disgust, yet\nthere was in it also the mark of imperious command and confident power. The\nleft half of the picture was the strangest, however. The interest plainly\ncentred there. On the pavement before the throne were grouped four soldiers,\nsurrounding a crouching figure which must be described in a moment. A fifth\nsoldier lay dead on the pavement, his neck distorted, and his eye-balls\nstarting from his head. The four surrounding guards were looking at the King.\nIn their faces, the sentiment of horror was intensified; they seemed, in fact,\nonly restrained from flight by their implicit trust in their master. All this\nterror was plainly excited by the being that crouched in their midst. I\nentirely despair of conveying by any words the impression which this figure\nmakes upon anyone who looks at it. I recollect once showing the photograph of\nthe drawing to a lecturer on morphology—a person of, I was going to say,\nabnormally sane and unimaginative habits of mind. He absolutely refused to be\nalone for the rest of that evening, and he told me afterwards that for many\nnights he had not dared to put out his light before going to sleep. However,\nthe main traits of the figure I can at least indicate. At first you saw only a\nmass of coarse, matted black hair; presently it was seen that this covered a\nbody of fearful thinness, almost a skeleton, but with the muscles standing out\nlike wires. The hands were of a dusky pallor, covered, like the body, with\nlong, coarse hairs, and hideously taloned. The eyes, touched in with a burning\nyellow, had intensely black pupils, and were fixed upon the throned King with a\nlook of beast-like hate. Imagine one of the awful bird-catching spiders of\nSouth America translated into human form, and endowed with intelligence just\nless than human, and you will have some faint conception of the terror inspired\nby the appalling effigy. One remark is universally made by those to whom I have\nshown the picture: “It was drawn from the life.”',
				'As soon as the first shock of his irresistible fright had subsided, Dennistoun\nstole a look at his hosts. The sacristan’s hands were pressed upon his\neyes; his daughter, looking up at the cross on the wall, was telling her beads\nfeverishly.',
				'At last the question was asked, “Is this book for sale?”',
				'There was the same hesitation, the same plunge of determination that he had\nnoticed before, and then came the welcome answer, “If monsieur\npleases.”',
				'“How much do you ask for it?”',
				'“I will take two hundred and fifty francs.”',
				'This was confounding. Even a collector’s conscience is sometimes stirred,\nand Dennistoun’s conscience was tenderer than a collector’s.',
				'“My good man!” he said again and again, “your book is worth\nfar more than two hundred and fifty francs, I assure you—far more.”',
				'But the answer did not vary: “I will take two hundred and fifty\nfrancs, not more.”',
				'There was really no possibility of refusing such a chance. The money was paid,\nthe receipt signed, a glass of wine drunk over the transaction, and then the\nsacristan seemed to become a new man. He stood upright, he ceased to throw\nthose suspicious glances behind him, he actually laughed or tried to laugh.\nDennistoun rose to go.',
				'“I shall have the honour of accompanying monsieur to his hotel?”\nsaid the sacristan.',
				'“Oh no, thanks! it isn’t a hundred yards. I know the way\nperfectly, and there is a moon.”',
				'The offer was pressed three or four times, and refused as often.',
				'“Then, monsieur will summon me if—if he finds occasion; he will\nkeep the middle of the road, the sides are so rough.”',
				'“Certainly, certainly,” said Dennistoun, who was impatient to\nexamine his prize by himself; and he stepped out into the passage with his book\nunder his arm.',
				'Here he was met by the daughter; she, it appeared, was anxious to do a little\nbusiness on her own account; perhaps, like Gehazi, to “take\nsomewhat” from the foreigner whom her father had spared.',
				'“A silver crucifix and chain for the neck; monsieur would perhaps be good\nenough to accept it?”',
				'Well, really, Dennistoun hadn’t much use for these things. What did\nmademoiselle want for it?',
				'“Nothing—nothing in the world. Monsieur is more than welcome to\nit.”',
				'The tone in which this and much more was said was unmistakably genuine, so that\nDennistoun was reduced to profuse thanks, and submitted to have the chain put\nround his neck. It really seemed as if he had rendered the father and daughter\nsome service which they hardly knew how to repay. As he set off with his book\nthey stood at the door looking after him, and they were still looking when he\nwaved them a last good night from the steps of the Chapeau Rouge.',
				'Dinner was over, and Dennistoun was in his bedroom, shut up alone with his\nacquisition. The landlady had manifested a particular interest in him since he\nhad told her that he had paid a visit to the sacristan and bought an old book\nfrom him. He thought, too, that he had heard a hurried dialogue between her and\nthe said sacristan in the passage outside the salle à manger; some words\nto the effect that “Pierre and Bertrand would be sleeping in the\nhouse” had closed the conversation.',
				'All this time a growing feeling of discomfort had been creeping over\nhim—nervous reaction, perhaps, after the delight of his discovery.\nWhatever it was, it resulted in a conviction that there was someone behind him,\nand that he was far more comfortable with his back to the wall. All this, of\ncourse, weighed light in the balance as against the obvious value of the\ncollection he had acquired. And now, as I said, he was alone in his bedroom,\ntaking stock of Canon Alberic’s treasures, in which every moment revealed\nsomething more charming.',
				'“Bless Canon Alberic!” said Dennistoun, who had an inveterate habit\nof talking to himself. “I wonder where he is now? Dear me! I wish that\nlandlady would learn to laugh in a more cheering manner; it makes one feel as\nif there was someone dead in the house. Half a pipe more, did you say? I think\nperhaps you are right. I wonder what that crucifix is that the young woman\ninsisted on giving me? Last century, I suppose. Yes, probably. It is rather a\nnuisance of a thing to have round one’s neck—just too heavy. Most\nlikely her father has been wearing it for years. I think I might give it a\nclean up before I put it away.”',
				'He had taken the crucifix off, and laid it on the table, when his attention was\ncaught by an object lying on the red cloth just by his left elbow. Two or three\nideas of what it might be flitted through his brain with their own incalculable\nquickness.',
				'“A penwiper? No, no such thing in the house. A rat? No, too black. A large\nspider? I trust to goodness not—no. Good God! a hand like the hand in\nthat picture!”',
				'In another infinitesimal flash he had taken it in. Pale, dusky skin, covering\nnothing but bones and tendons of appalling strength; coarse black hairs, longer\nthan ever grew on a human hand; nails rising from the ends of the fingers and\ncurving sharply down and forward, grey, horny and wrinkled.',
				'He flew out of his chair with deadly, inconceivable terror clutching at his\nheart. The shape, whose left hand rested on the table, was rising to a standing\nposture behind his seat, its right hand crooked above his scalp. There was\nblack and tattered drapery about it; the coarse hair covered it as in the\ndrawing. The lower jaw was thin—what can I call it?—shallow, like a\nbeast’s; teeth showed behind the black lips; there was no nose; the eyes,\nof a fiery yellow, against which the pupils showed black and intense, and the\nexulting hate and thirst to destroy life which shone there, were the most\nhorrifying features in the whole vision. There was intelligence of a kind in\nthem—intelligence beyond that of a beast, below that of a man.',
				'The feelings which this horror stirred in Dennistoun were the intensest\nphysical fear and the most profound mental loathing. What did he do? What could\nhe do? He has never been quite certain what words he said, but he knows that he\nspoke, that he grasped blindly at the silver crucifix, that he was conscious of\na movement towards him on the part of the demon, and that he screamed with the\nvoice of an animal in hideous pain.',
				'Pierre and Bertrand, the two sturdy little serving-men, who rushed in, saw\nnothing, but felt themselves thrust aside by something that passed out between\nthem, and found Dennistoun in a swoon. They sat up with him that night, and his\ntwo friends were at St Bertrand by nine o’clock next morning. He himself,\nthough still shaken and nervous, was almost himself by that time, and his story\nfound credence with them, though not until they had seen the drawing and talked\nwith the sacristan.',
				'Almost at dawn the little man had come to the inn on some pretence, and had\nlistened with the deepest interest to the story retailed by the landlady. He\nshowed no surprise.',
				'“It is he—it is he! I have seen him myself,” was his only\ncomment; and to all questionings but one reply was vouchsafed: “Deux fois\nje l’ai vu; mille fois je l’ai senti.” He would tell them\nnothing of the provenance of the book, nor any details of his experiences.\n“I shall soon sleep, and my rest will be sweet. Why should you trouble\nme?” he said.[2]',
				'[2]\nHe died that summer; his daughter married, and settled at St Papoul. She never\nunderstood the circumstances of her father’s “obsession”.',
				'We shall never know what he or Canon Alberic de Mauléon suffered. At the back\nof that fateful drawing were some lines of writing which may be supposed to\nthrow light on the situation:',
				'Contradictio Salomonis cum demonio nocturno.\nAlbericus de Mauléone delineavit.\nV. Deus in adiutorium. Ps. Qui habitat.\nSancte Bertrande, demoniorum effugator, intercede pro me miserrimo.\nPrimum uidi nocte 12(mi) Dec. 1694:\nuidebo mox ultimum. Peccaui et passus\nsum, plura adhuc passurus.\nDec. 29, 1701.[3]',
				'[3]\ni.e., The Dispute of Solomon with a demon of the night. Drawn by Alberic\nde Mauléon. Versicle. O Lord, make haste to help me. Psalm. Whoso\ndwelleth xci.\n    Saint Bertrand, who puttest devils to flight, pray for me most unhappy. I\nsaw it first on the night of Dec. 12, 1694: soon I shall see it for the last\ntime. I have sinned and suffered, and have more to suffer yet. Dec. 29, 1701.\n    The “Gallia Christiana” gives the date of the Canon’s\ndeath as December 31, 1701, “in bed, of a sudden seizure”. Details\nof this kind are not common in the great work of the Sammarthani.',
				'I have never quite understood what was Dennistoun’s view of the events I\nhave narrated. He quoted to me once a text from Ecclesiasticus: “Some\nspirits there be that are created for vengeance, and in their fury lay on sore\nstrokes.” On another occasion he said: “Isaiah was a very sensible\nman; doesn’t he say something about night monsters living in the ruins of\nBabylon? These things are rather beyond us at present.”',
				'Another confidence of his impressed me rather, and I sympathized with it. We\nhad been, last year, to Comminges, to see Canon Alberic’s tomb. It is a\ngreat marble erection with an effigy of the Canon in a large wig and soutane,\nand an elaborate eulogy of his learning below. I saw Dennistoun talking for\nsome time with the Vicar of St Bertrand’s, and as we drove away he said\nto me: “I hope it isn’t wrong: you know I am a\nPresbyterian—but I—I believe there will be ‘saying of Mass\nand singing of dirges’ for Alberic de Mauléon’s rest.” Then\nhe added, with a touch of the Northern British in his tone, “I had no\nnotion they came so dear.”',
				'The book is in the Wentworth Collection at Cambridge. The drawing was\nphotographed and then burnt by Dennistoun on the day when he left Comminges on\nthe occasion of his first visit.',

				'It was, as far as I can ascertain, in September of the year 1811 that a\npost-chaise drew up before the door of Aswarby Hall, in the heart of\nLincolnshire. The little boy who was the only passenger in the chaise, and who\njumped out as soon as it had stopped, looked about him with the keenest\ncuriosity during the short interval that elapsed between the ringing of the\nbell and the opening of the hall door. He saw a tall, square, red-brick house,\nbuilt in the reign of Anne; a stone-pillared porch had been added in the purer\nclassical style of 1790; the windows of the house were many, tall and narrow,\nwith small panes and thick white woodwork. A pediment, pierced with a round\nwindow, crowned the front. There were wings to right and left, connected by\ncurious glazed galleries, supported by colonnades, with the central block.\nThese wings plainly contained the stables and offices of the house. Each was\nsurmounted by an ornamental cupola with a gilded vane.',
				'An evening light shone on the building, making the window-panes glow like so\nmany fires. Away from the Hall in front stretched a flat park studded with oaks\nand fringed with firs, which stood out against the sky. The clock in the\nchurch-tower, buried in trees on the edge of the park, only its golden\nweather-cock catching the light, was striking six, and the sound came gently\nbeating down the wind. It was altogether a pleasant impression, though tinged\nwith the sort of melancholy appropriate to an evening in early autumn, that was\nconveyed to the mind of the boy who was standing in the porch waiting for the\ndoor to open to him.',
				'The post-chaise had brought him from Warwickshire, where, some six months\nbefore, he had been left an orphan. Now, owing to the generous offer of his\nelderly cousin, Mr Abney, he had come to live at Aswarby. The offer was\nunexpected, because all who knew anything of Mr Abney looked upon him as a\nsomewhat austere recluse, into whose steady-going household the advent of a\nsmall boy would import a new and, it seemed, incongruous element. The truth is\nthat very little was known of Mr Abney’s pursuits or temper. The\nProfessor of Greek at Cambridge had been heard to say that no one knew more of\nthe religious beliefs of the later pagans than did the owner of Aswarby.\nCertainly his library contained all the then available books bearing on the\nMysteries, the Orphic poems, the worship of Mithras, and the Neo-Platonists. In\nthe marble-paved hall stood a fine group of Mithras slaying a bull, which had\nbeen imported from the Levant at great expense by the owner. He had contributed\na description of it to the Gentleman’s Magazine, and he had\nwritten a remarkable series of articles in the Critical Museum on the\nsuperstitions of the Romans of the Lower Empire. He was looked upon, in fine,\nas a man wrapped up in his books, and it was a matter of great surprise among\nhis neighbours that he should ever have heard of his orphan cousin, Stephen\nElliott, much more that he should have volunteered to make him an inmate of\nAswarby Hall.',
				'Whatever may have been expected by his neighbours, it is certain that Mr\nAbney—the tall, the thin, the austere—seemed inclined to give his\nyoung cousin a kindly reception. The moment the front-door was opened he darted\nout of his study, rubbing his hands with delight.',
				'“How are you, my boy?—how are you? How old are you?” said\nhe—“that is, you are not too much tired, I hope, by your journey to\neat your supper?”',
				'“No, thank you, sir,” said Master Elliott; “I am pretty\nwell.”',
				'“That’s a good lad,” said Mr Abney. “And how old are\nyou, my boy?”',
				'It seemed a little odd that he should have asked the question twice in the\nfirst two minutes of their acquaintance.',
				'“I’m twelve years old next birthday, sir,” said Stephen.',
				'“And when is your birthday, my dear boy? Eleventh of September, eh?\nThat’s well—that’s very well. Nearly a year hence,\nisn’t it? I like—ha, ha!—I like to get these things down in\nmy book. Sure it’s twelve? Certain?”',
				'“Yes, quite sure, sir.”',
				'“Well, well! Take him to Mrs Bunch’s room, Parkes, and let him have\nhis tea—supper—whatever it is.”',
				'“Yes, sir,” answered the staid Mr Parkes; and conducted Stephen to\nthe lower regions.',
				'Mrs Bunch was the most comfortable and human person whom Stephen had as yet met\nin Aswarby. She made him completely at home; they were great friends in a\nquarter of an hour: and great friends they remained. Mrs Bunch had been born in\nthe neighbourhood some fifty-five years before the date of Stephen’s\narrival, and her residence at the Hall was of twenty years’ standing.\nConsequently, if anyone knew the ins and outs of the house and the district,\nMrs Bunch knew them; and she was by no means disinclined to communicate her\ninformation.',
				'Certainly there were plenty of things about the Hall and the Hall gardens which\nStephen, who was of an adventurous and inquiring turn, was anxious to have\nexplained to him. “Who built the temple at the end of the laurel walk?\nWho was the old man whose picture hung on the staircase, sitting at a table,\nwith a skull under his hand?” These and many similar points were cleared\nup by the resources of Mrs Bunch’s powerful intellect. There were others,\nhowever, of which the explanations furnished were less satisfactory.',
				'One November evening Stephen was sitting by the fire in the housekeeper’s\nroom reflecting on his surroundings.',
				'“Is Mr Abney a good man, and will he go to heaven?” he suddenly\nasked, with the peculiar confidence which children possess in the ability of\ntheir elders to settle these questions, the decision of which is believed to be\nreserved for other tribunals.',
				'“Good?—bless the child!” said Mrs Bunch.\n“Master’s as kind a soul as ever I see! Didn’t I never tell\nyou of the little boy as he took in out of the street, as you may say, this\nseven years back? and the little girl, two years after I first come\nhere?”',
				'“No. Do tell me all about them, Mrs Bunch—now, this minute!”',
				'“Well,” said Mrs Bunch, “the little girl I don’t seem\nto recollect so much about. I know master brought her back with him from his\nwalk one day, and give orders to Mrs Ellis, as was housekeeper then, as she\nshould be took every care with. And the pore child hadn’t no one\nbelonging to her—she telled me so her own self—and here she lived\nwith us a matter of three weeks it might be; and then, whether she were\nsomethink of a gipsy in her blood or what not, but one morning she out of her\nbed afore any of us had opened a eye, and neither track nor yet trace of her\nhave I set eyes on since. Master was wonderful put about, and had all the ponds\ndragged; but it’s my belief she was had away by them gipsies, for there\nwas singing round the house for as much as an hour the night she went, and\nParkes, he declare as he heard them a-calling in the woods all that afternoon.\nDear, dear! a hodd child she was, so silent in her ways and all, but I was\nwonderful taken up with her, so domesticated she was—surprising.”',
				'“And what about the little boy?” said Stephen.',
				'“Ah, that pore boy!” sighed Mrs Bunch. “He were a\nforeigner—Jevanny he called hisself—and he come a-tweaking his\n’urdy-gurdy round and about the drive one winter day, and master\n’ad him in that minute, and ast all about where he came from, and how old\nhe was, and how he made his way, and where was his relatives, and all as kind\nas heart could wish. But it went the same way with him. They’re a hunruly\nlot, them foreign nations, I do suppose, and he was off one fine morning just\nthe same as the girl. Why he went and what he done was our question for as much\nas a year after; for he never took his ’urdy-gurdy, and there it lays on\nthe shelf.”',
				'The remainder of the evening was spent by Stephen in miscellaneous\ncross-examination of Mrs Bunch and in efforts to extract a tune from the\nhurdy-gurdy.',
				'That night he had a curious dream. At the end of the passage at the top of the\nhouse, in which his bedroom was situated, there was an old disused bathroom. It\nwas kept locked, but the upper half of the door was glazed, and, since the\nmuslin curtains which used to hang there had long been gone, you could look in\nand see the lead-lined bath affixed to the wall on the right hand, with its\nhead towards the window.',
				'On the night of which I am speaking, Stephen Elliott found himself, as he\nthought, looking through the glazed door. The moon was shining through the\nwindow, and he was gazing at a figure which lay in the bath.',
				'His description of what he saw reminds me of what I once beheld myself in the\nfamous vaults of St Michan’s Church in Dublin, which possess the horrid\nproperty of preserving corpses from decay for centuries. A figure inexpressibly\nthin and pathetic, of a dusty leaden colour, enveloped in a shroud-like\ngarment, the thin lips crooked into a faint and dreadful smile, the hands\npressed tightly over the region of the heart.',
				'As he looked upon it, a distant, almost inaudible moan seemed to issue from its\nlips, and the arms began to stir. The terror of the sight forced Stephen\nbackwards, and he awoke to the fact that he was indeed standing on the cold\nboarded floor of the passage in the full light of the moon. With a courage\nwhich I do not think can be common among boys of his age, he went to the door\nof the bathroom to ascertain if the figure of his dream were really there. It\nwas not, and he went back to bed.',
				'Mrs Bunch was much impressed next morning by his story, and went so far as to\nreplace the muslin curtain over the glazed door of the bathroom. Mr Abney,\nmoreover, to whom he confided his experiences at breakfast, was greatly\ninterested, and made notes of the matter in what he called “his\nbook”.',
				'The spring equinox was approaching, as Mr Abney frequently reminded his cousin,\nadding that this had been always considered by the ancients to be a critical\ntime for the young: that Stephen would do well to take care of himself, and to\nshut his bedroom window at night; and that Censorinus had some valuable remarks\non the subject. Two incidents that occurred about this time made an impression\nupon Stephen’s mind.',
				'The first was after an unusually uneasy and oppressed night that he had\npassed—though he could not recall any particular dream that he had had.',
				'The following evening Mrs Bunch was occupying herself in mending his nightgown.',
				'“Gracious me, Master Stephen!” she broke forth rather irritably,\n“how do you manage to tear your nightdress all to flinders this way? Look\nhere, sir, what trouble you do give to poor servants that have to darn and mend\nafter you!”',
				'There was indeed a most destructive and apparently wanton series of slits or\nscorings in the garment, which would undoubtedly require a skilful needle to\nmake good. They were confined to the left side of the chest—long,\nparallel slits, about six inches in length, some of them not quite piercing the\ntexture of the linen. Stephen could only express his entire ignorance of their\norigin: he was sure they were not there the night before.',
				'“But,” he said, “Mrs Bunch, they are just the same as the\nscratches on the outside of my bedroom door; and I’m sure I never had\nanything to do with making them.”',
				'Mrs Bunch gazed at him open-mouthed, then snatched up a candle, departed\nhastily from the room, and was heard making her way upstairs. In a few minutes\nshe came down.',
				'“Well,” she said, “Master Stephen, it’s a funny thing\nto me how them marks and scratches can ’a’ come there—too\nhigh up for any cat or dog to ’ave made ’em, much less a rat: for\nall the world like a Chinaman’s finger-nails, as my uncle in the\ntea-trade used to tell us of when we was girls together. I wouldn’t say\nnothing to master, not if I was you, Master Stephen, my dear; and just turn the\nkey of the door when you go to your bed.”',
				'“I always do, Mrs Bunch, as soon as I’ve said my prayers.”',
				'“Ah, that’s a good child: always say your prayers, and then no one\ncan’t hurt you.”',
				'Herewith Mrs Bunch addressed herself to mending the injured nightgown, with\nintervals of meditation, until bed-time. This was on a Friday night in March,\n1812.',
				'On the following evening the usual duet of Stephen and Mrs Bunch was augmented\nby the sudden arrival of Mr Parkes, the butler, who as a rule kept himself\nrather to himself in his own pantry. He did not see that Stephen was\nthere: he was, moreover, flustered and less slow of speech than was his wont.',
				'“Master may get up his own wine, if he likes, of an evening,” was\nhis first remark. “Either I do it in the daytime or not at all, Mrs\nBunch. I don’t know what it may be: very like it’s the rats, or the\nwind got into the cellars; but I’m not so young as I was, and I\ncan’t go through with it as I have done.”',
				'“Well, Mr Parkes, you know it is a surprising place for the rats, is the\nHall.”',
				'“I’m not denying that, Mrs Bunch; and, to be sure, many a time\nI’ve heard the tale from the men in the shipyards about the rat that\ncould speak. I never laid no confidence in that before; but tonight, if\nI’d demeaned myself to lay my ear to the door of the further bin, I could\npretty much have heard what they was saying.”',
				'“Oh, there, Mr Parkes, I’ve no patience with your fancies! Rats\ntalking in the wine-cellar indeed!”',
				'“Well, Mrs Bunch, I’ve no wish to argue with you: all I say is, if\nyou choose to go to the far bin, and lay your ear to the door, you may prove my\nwords this minute.”',
				'“What nonsense you do talk, Mr Parkes—not fit for children to\nlisten to! Why, you’ll be frightening Master Stephen there out of his\nwits.”',
				'“What! Master Stephen?” said Parkes, awaking to the consciousness\nof the boy’s presence. “Master Stephen knows well enough when\nI’m a-playing a joke with you, Mrs Bunch.”',
				'In fact, Master Stephen knew much too well to suppose that Mr Parkes had in the\nfirst instance intended a joke. He was interested, not altogether pleasantly,\nin the situation; but all his questions were unsuccessful in inducing the\nbutler to give any more detailed account of his experiences in the wine-cellar.',
				'We have now arrived at March 24, 1812. It was a day of curious experiences for\nStephen: a windy, noisy day, which filled the house and the gardens with a\nrestless impression. As Stephen stood by the fence of the grounds, and looked\nout into the park, he felt as if an endless procession of unseen people were\nsweeping past him on the wind, borne on resistlessly and aimlessly, vainly\nstriving to stop themselves, to catch at something that might arrest their\nflight and bring them once again into contact with the living world of which\nthey had formed a part. After luncheon that day Mr Abney said:',
				'“Stephen, my boy, do you think you could manage to come to me tonight as\nlate as eleven o’clock in my study? I shall be busy until that time, and\nI wish to show you something connected with your future life which it is most\nimportant that you should know. You are not to mention this matter to Mrs Bunch\nnor to anyone else in the house; and you had better go to your room at the\nusual time.”',
				'Here was a new excitement added to life: Stephen eagerly grasped at the\nopportunity of sitting up till eleven o’clock. He looked in at the\nlibrary door on his way upstairs that evening, and saw a brazier, which he had\noften noticed in the corner of the room, moved out before the fire; an old\nsilver-gilt cup stood on the table, filled with red wine, and some written\nsheets of paper lay near it. Mr Abney was sprinkling some incense on the\nbrazier from a round silver box as Stephen passed, but did not seem to notice\nhis step.',
				'The wind had fallen, and there was a still night and a full moon. At about ten\no’clock Stephen was standing at the open window of his bedroom, looking\nout over the country. Still as the night was, the mysterious population of the\ndistant moon-lit woods was not yet lulled to rest. From time to time strange\ncries as of lost and despairing wanderers sounded from across the mere. They\nmight be the notes of owls or water-birds, yet they did not quite resemble\neither sound. Were not they coming nearer? Now they sounded from the nearer\nside of the water, and in a few moments they seemed to be floating about among\nthe shrubberies. Then they ceased; but just as Stephen was thinking of shutting\nthe window and resuming his reading of Robinson Crusoe, he caught sight\nof two figures standing on the gravelled terrace that ran along the garden side\nof the Hall—the figures of a boy and girl, as it seemed; they stood side\nby side, looking up at the windows. Something in the form of the girl recalled\nirresistibly his dream of the figure in the bath. The boy inspired him with\nmore acute fear.',
				'Whilst the girl stood still, half smiling, with her hands clasped over her\nheart, the boy, a thin shape, with black hair and ragged clothing, raised his\narms in the air with an appearance of menace and of unappeasable hunger and\nlonging. The moon shone upon his almost transparent hands, and Stephen saw that\nthe nails were fearfully long and that the light shone through them. As he\nstood with his arms thus raised, he disclosed a terrifying spectacle. On the\nleft side of his chest there opened a black and gaping rent; and there fell\nupon Stephen’s brain, rather than upon his ear, the impression of one of\nthose hungry and desolate cries that he had heard resounding over the woods of\nAswarby all that evening. In another moment this dreadful pair had moved\nswiftly and noiselessly over the dry gravel, and he saw them no more.',
				'Inexpressibly frightened as he was, he determined to take his candle and go\ndown to Mr Abney’s study, for the hour appointed for their meeting was\nnear at hand. The study or library opened out of the front-hall on one side,\nand Stephen, urged on by his terrors, did not take long in getting there. To\neffect an entrance was not so easy. It was not locked, he felt sure, for the\nkey was on the outside of the door as usual. His repeated knocks produced no\nanswer. Mr Abney was engaged: he was speaking. What! why did he try to cry out?\nand why was the cry choked in his throat? Had he, too, seen the mysterious\nchildren? But now everything was quiet, and the door yielded to Stephen’s\nterrified and frantic pushing.',
				'On the table in Mr Abney’s study certain papers were found which\nexplained the situation to Stephen Elliott when he was of an age to understand\nthem. The most important sentences were as follows:',
				'“It was a belief very strongly and generally held by the\nancients—of whose wisdom in these matters I have had such experience as\ninduces me to place confidence in their assertions—that by enacting\ncertain processes, which to us moderns have something of a barbaric complexion,\na very remarkable enlightenment of the spiritual faculties in man may be\nattained: that, for example, by absorbing the personalities of a certain number\nof his fellow-creatures, an individual may gain a complete ascendancy over\nthose orders of spiritual beings which control the elemental forces of our\nuniverse.',
				'“It is recorded of Simon Magus that he was able to fly in the air, to\nbecome invisible, or to assume any form he pleased, by the agency of the soul\nof a boy whom, to use the libellous phrase employed by the author of the\nClementine Recognitions, he had ‘murdered’. I find it set\ndown, moreover, with considerable detail in the writings of Hermes\nTrismegistus, that similar happy results may be produced by the absorption of\nthe hearts of not less than three human beings below the age of twenty-one\nyears. To the testing of the truth of this receipt I have devoted the greater\npart of the last twenty years, selecting as the corpora vilia of my\nexperiment such persons as could conveniently be removed without occasioning a\nsensible gap in society. The first step I effected by the removal of one Phoebe\nStanley, a girl of gipsy extraction, on March 24, 1792. The second, by the\nremoval of a wandering Italian lad, named Giovanni Paoli, on the night of March\n23, 1805. The final ‘victim’—to employ a word repugnant in\nthe highest degree to my feelings—must be my cousin, Stephen Elliott. His\nday must be this March 24, 1812.',
				'“The best means of effecting the required absorption is to remove the\nheart from the living subject, to reduce it to ashes, and to mingle them\nwith about a pint of some red wine, preferably port. The remains of the first\ntwo subjects, at least, it will be well to conceal: a disused bathroom or\nwine-cellar will be found convenient for such a purpose. Some annoyance may be\nexperienced from the psychic portion of the subjects, which popular language\ndignifies with the name of ghosts. But the man of philosophic\ntemperament—to whom alone the experiment is appropriate—will be\nlittle prone to attach importance to the feeble efforts of these beings to\nwreak their vengeance on him. I contemplate with the liveliest satisfaction the\nenlarged and emancipated existence which the experiment, if successful, will\nconfer on me; not only placing me beyond the reach of human justice\n(so-called), but eliminating to a great extent the prospect of death\nitself.”',
				'Mr Abney was found in his chair, his head thrown back, his face stamped with an\nexpression of rage, fright, and mortal pain. In his left side was a terrible\nlacerated wound, exposing the heart. There was no blood on his hands, and a\nlong knife that lay on the table was perfectly clean. A savage wild-cat might\nhave inflicted the injuries. The window of the study was open, and it was the\nopinion of the coroner that Mr Abney had met his death by the agency of some\nwild creature. But Stephen Elliott’s study of the papers I have quoted\nled him to a very different conclusion.',

			title: 'The Mezzotint',
			content: [
				'Some time ago I believe I had the pleasure of telling you the story of an\nadventure which happened to a friend of mine by the name of Dennistoun, during\nhis pursuit of objects of art for the museum at Cambridge.',
				'He did not publish his experiences very widely upon his return to England; but\nthey could not fail to become known to a good many of his friends, and among\nothers to the gentleman who at that time presided over an art museum at another\nUniversity. It was to be expected that the story should make a considerable\nimpression on the mind of a man whose vocation lay in lines similar to\nDennistoun’s, and that he should be eager to catch at any explanation of\nthe matter which tended to make it seem improbable that he should ever be\ncalled upon to deal with so agitating an emergency. It was, indeed, somewhat\nconsoling to him to reflect that he was not expected to acquire ancient MSS.\nfor his institution; that was the business of the Shelburnian Library. The\nauthorities of that institution might, if they pleased, ransack obscure corners\nof the Continent for such matters. He was glad to be obliged at the moment to\nconfine his attention to enlarging the already unsurpassed collection of\nEnglish topographical drawings and engravings possessed by his museum. Yet, as\nit turned out, even a department so homely and familiar as this may have its\ndark corners, and to one of these Mr Williams was unexpectedly introduced.',
				'Those who have taken even the most limited interest in the acquisition of\ntopographical pictures are aware that there is one London dealer whose aid is\nindispensable to their researches. Mr J. W. Britnell publishes at short\nintervals very admirable catalogues of a large and constantly changing stock of\nengravings, plans, and old sketches of mansions, churches, and towns in England\nand Wales. These catalogues were, of course, the ABC of his subject to Mr\nWilliams: but as his museum already contained an enormous accumulation of\ntopographical pictures, he was a regular, rather than a copious, buyer; and he\nrather looked to Mr Britnell to fill up gaps in the rank and file of his\ncollection than to supply him with rarities.',
				'Now, in February of last year there appeared upon Mr Williams’s desk at\nthe museum a catalogue from Mr Britnell’s emporium, and accompanying it\nwas a typewritten communication from the dealer himself. This latter ran as\nfollows:',
				'DEAR SIR,\n    We beg to call your attention to No. 978 in our accompanying catalogue,\nwhich we shall be glad to send on approval.',
				'Yours faithfully,\nJ. W. BRITNELL.',
				'To turn to No. 978 in the accompanying catalogue was with Mr. Williams (as he\nobserved to himself) the work of a moment, and in the place indicated he found\nthe following entry:',
				'978.—Unknown. Interesting mezzotint: View of a manor-house, early\npart of the century. 15 by 10 inches; black frame. £2 2s.',
				'It was not specially exciting, and the price seemed high. However, as Mr\nBritnell, who knew his business and his customer, seemed to set store by it, Mr\nWilliams wrote a postcard asking for the article to be sent on approval, along\nwith some other engravings and sketches which appeared in the same catalogue.\nAnd so he passed without much excitement of anticipation to the ordinary\nlabours of the day.',
				'A parcel of any kind always arrives a day later than you expect it, and that of\nMr Britnell proved, as I believe the right phrase goes, no exception to the\nrule. It was delivered at the museum by the afternoon post of Saturday, after\nMr Williams had left his work, and it was accordingly brought round to his\nrooms in college by the attendant, in order that he might not have to wait over\nSunday before looking through it and returning such of the contents as he did\nnot propose to keep. And here he found it when he came in to tea, with a\nfriend.',
				'The only item with which I am concerned was the rather large, black-framed\nmezzotint of which I have already quoted the short description given in Mr\nBritnell’s catalogue. Some more details of it will have to be given,\nthough I cannot hope to put before you the look of the picture as clearly as it\nis present to my own eye. Very nearly the exact duplicate of it may be seen in\na good many old inn parlours, or in the passages of undisturbed country\nmansions at the present moment. It was a rather indifferent mezzotint, and an\nindifferent mezzotint is, perhaps, the worst form of engraving known. It\npresented a full-face view of a not very large manor-house of the last century,\nwith three rows of plain sashed windows with rusticated masonry about them, a\nparapet with balls or vases at the angles, and a small portico in the centre.\nOn either side were trees, and in front a considerable expanse of lawn. The\nlegend A. W. F. sculpsit was engraved on the narrow margin; and there\nwas no further inscription. The whole thing gave the impression that it was the\nwork of an amateur. What in the world Mr Britnell could mean by affixing the\nprice of £2 2s. to such an object was more than Mr Williams could imagine. He\nturned it over with a good deal of contempt; upon the back was a paper label,\nthe left-hand half of which had been torn off. All that remained were the ends\nof two lines of writing: the first had the letters—ngley Hall; the\nsecond,—ssex.',
				'It would, perhaps, be just worth while to identify the place represented, which\nhe could easily do with the help of a gazetteer, and then he would send it back\nto Mr Britnell, with some remarks reflecting upon the judgement of that\ngentleman.',
				'He lighted the candles, for it was now dark, made the tea, and supplied the\nfriend with whom he had been playing golf (for I believe the authorities of the\nUniversity I write of indulge in that pursuit by way of relaxation); and tea\nwas taken to the accompaniment of a discussion which golfing persons can\nimagine for themselves, but which the conscientious writer has no right to\ninflict upon any non-golfing persons.',
				'The conclusion arrived at was that certain strokes might have been better, and\nthat in certain emergencies neither player had experienced that amount of luck\nwhich a human being has a right to expect. It was now that the friend—let\nus call him Professor Binks—took up the framed engraving, and said:',
				'“What’s this place, Williams?”',
				'“Just what I am going to try to find out,” said Williams, going to\nthe shelf for a gazetteer. “Look at the back. Somethingley Hall, either\nin Sussex or Essex. Half the name’s gone, you see. You don’t happen\nto know it, I suppose?”',
				'“It’s from that man Britnell, I suppose, isn’t it?”\nsaid Binks. “Is it for the museum?”',
				'“Well, I think I should buy it if the price was five shillings,”\nsaid Williams; “but for some unearthly reason he wants two guineas for\nit. I can’t conceive why. It’s a wretched engraving, and there\naren’t even any figures to give it life.”',
				'“It’s not worth two guineas, I should think,” said Binks;\n“but I don’t think it’s so badly done. The moonlight seems\nrather good to me; and I should have thought there were figures, or at\nleast a figure, just on the edge in front.”',
				'“Let’s look,” said Williams. “Well, it’s true the\nlight is rather cleverly given. Where’s your figure? Oh yes! Just the\nhead, in the very front of the picture.”',
				'And indeed there was—hardly more than a black blot on the extreme edge of\nthe engraving—the head of a man or woman, a good deal muffled up, the\nback turned to the spectator, and looking towards the house.',
				'Williams had not noticed it before.',
				'“Still,” he said, “though it’s a cleverer thing than I\nthought, I can’t spend two guineas of museum money on a picture of a\nplace I don’t know.”',
				'Professor Binks had his work to do, and soon went; and very nearly up to Hall\ntime Williams was engaged in a vain attempt to identify the subject of his\npicture. “If the vowel before the ng had only been left, it would\nhave been easy enough,” he thought; “but as it is, the name may be\nanything from Guestingley to Langley, and there are many more names ending like\nthis than I thought; and this rotten book has no index of terminations.”',
				'Hall in Mr Williams’s college was at seven. It need not be dwelt upon;\nthe less so as he met there colleagues who had been playing golf during the\nafternoon, and words with which we have no concern were freely bandied across\nthe table—merely golfing words, I would hasten to explain.',
				'I suppose an hour or more to have been spent in what is called common-room\nafter dinner. Later in the evening some few retired to Williams’s rooms,\nand I have little doubt that whist was played and tobacco smoked. During a lull\nin these operations Williams picked up the mezzotint from the table without\nlooking at it, and handed it to a person mildly interested in art, telling him\nwhere it had come from, and the other particulars which we already know.',
				'The gentleman took it carelessly, looked at it, then said, in a tone of some\ninterest:',
				'“It’s really a very good piece of work, Williams; it has quite a\nfeeling of the romantic period. The light is admirably managed, it seems to me,\nand the figure, though it’s rather too grotesque, is somehow very\nimpressive.”',
				'“Yes, isn’t it?” said Williams, who was just then busy giving\nwhisky-and-soda to others of the company, and was unable to come across the\nroom to look at the view again.',
				'It was by this time rather late in the evening, and the visitors were on the\nmove. After they went Williams was obliged to write a letter or two and clear\nup some odd bits of work. At last, some time past midnight, he was disposed to\nturn in, and he put out his lamp after lighting his bedroom candle. The picture\nlay face upwards on the table where the last man who looked at it had put it,\nand it caught his eye as he turned the lamp down. What he saw made him very\nnearly drop the candle on the floor, and he declares now that if he had been\nleft in the dark at that moment he would have had a fit. But, as that did not\nhappen, he was able to put down the light on the table and take a good look at\nthe picture. It was indubitable—rankly impossible, no doubt, but\nabsolutely certain. In the middle of the lawn in front of the unknown house\nthere was a figure where no figure had been at five o’clock that\nafternoon. It was crawling on all-fours towards the house, and it was muffled\nin a strange black garment with a white cross on the back.',
				'I do not know what is the ideal course to pursue in a situation of this kind. I\ncan only tell you what Mr Williams did. He took the picture by one corner and\ncarried it across the passage to a second set of rooms which he possessed.\nThere he locked it up in a drawer, sported the doors of both sets of rooms, and\nretired to bed; but first he wrote out and signed an account of the\nextraordinary change which the picture had undergone since it had come into his\npossession.',
				'Sleep visited him rather late; but it was consoling to reflect that the\nbehaviour of the picture did not depend upon his own unsupported testimony.\nEvidently the man who had looked at it the night before had seen something of\nthe same kind as he had, otherwise he might have been tempted to think that\nsomething gravely wrong was happening either to his eyes or his mind. This\npossibility being fortunately precluded, two matters awaited him on the morrow.\nHe must take stock of the picture very carefully, and call in a witness for the\npurpose, and he must make a determined effort to ascertain what house it was\nthat was represented. He would therefore ask his neighbour Nisbet to breakfast\nwith him, and he would subsequently spend a morning over the gazetteer.',
				'Nisbet was disengaged, and arrived about 9.30. His host was not quite dressed,\nI am sorry to say, even at this late hour. During breakfast nothing was said\nabout the mezzotint by Williams, save that he had a picture on which he wished\nfor Nisbet’s opinion. But those who are familiar with University life can\npicture for themselves the wide and delightful range of subjects over which the\nconversation of two Fellows of Canterbury College is likely to extend during a\nSunday morning breakfast. Hardly a topic was left unchallenged, from golf to\nlawn-tennis. Yet I am bound to say that Williams was rather distraught; for his\ninterest naturally centred in that very strange picture which was now reposing,\nface downwards, in the drawer in the room opposite.',
				'The morning pipe was at last lighted, and the moment had arrived for which he\nlooked. With very considerable—almost tremulous—excitement he ran\nacross, unlocked the drawer, and, extracting the picture—still face\ndownwards—ran back, and put it into Nisbet’s hands.',
				'“Now,” he said, “Nisbet, I want you to tell me exactly what\nyou see in that picture. Describe it, if you don’t mind, rather minutely.\nI’ll tell you why afterwards.”',
				'“Well,” said Nisbet, “I have here a view of a\ncountry-house—English, I presume—by moonlight.”',
				'“Moonlight? You’re sure of that?”',
				'“Certainly. The moon appears to be on the wane, if you wish for details,\nand there are clouds in the sky.”',
				'“All right. Go on. I’ll swear,” added Williams in an aside,\n“there was no moon when I saw it first.”',
				'“Well, there’s not much more to be said,” Nisbet continued.\n“The house has one—two—three rows of windows, five in each\nrow, except at the bottom, where there’s a porch instead of the middle\none, and—”',
				'“But what about figures?” said Williams, with marked interest.',
				'“There aren’t any,” said Nisbet; “but—”',
				'“What! No figure on the grass in front?”',
				'“Not a thing.”',
				'“You’ll swear to that?”',
				'“Certainly I will. But there’s just one other thing.”',
				'“What?”',
				'“Why, one of the windows on the ground-floor—left of the\ndoor—is open.”',
				'“Is it really so? My goodness! he must have got in,” said Williams,\nwith great excitement; and he hurried to the back of the sofa on which Nisbet\nwas sitting, and, catching the picture from him, verified the matter for\nhimself.',
				'It was quite true. There was no figure, and there was the open window.\nWilliams, after a moment of speechless surprise, went to the writing-table and\nscribbled for a short time. Then he brought two papers to Nisbet, and asked him\nfirst to sign one—it was his own description of the picture, which you\nhave just heard—and then to read the other which was Williams’s\nstatement written the night before.',
				'“What can it all mean?” said Nisbet.',
				'“Exactly,” said Williams. “Well, one thing I must do—or\nthree things, now I think of it. I must find out from Garwood”—this\nwas his last night’s visitor—“what he saw, and then I must\nget the thing photographed before it goes further, and then I must find out\nwhat the place is.”',
				'“I can do the photographing myself,” said Nisbet, “and I\nwill. But, you know, it looks very much as if we were assisting at the working\nout of a tragedy somewhere. The question is, has it happened already, or is it\ngoing to come off? You must find out what the place is. Yes,” he said,\nlooking at the picture again, “I expect you’re right: he has got\nin. And if I don’t mistake there’ll be the devil to pay in one of\nthe rooms upstairs.”',
				'“I’ll tell you what,” said Williams: “I’ll take\nthe picture across to old Green” (this was the senior Fellow of the\nCollege, who had been Bursar for many years). “It’s quite likely\nhe’ll know it. We have property in Essex and Sussex, and he must have\nbeen over the two counties a lot in his time.”',
				'“Quite likely he will,” said Nisbet; “but just let me take my\nphotograph first. But look here, I rather think Green isn’t up today. He\nwasn’t in Hall last night, and I think I heard him say he was going down\nfor the Sunday.”',
				'“That’s true, too,” said Williams; “I know he’s\ngone to Brighton. Well, if you’ll photograph it now, I’ll go across\nto Garwood and get his statement, and you keep an eye on it while I’m\ngone. I’m beginning to think two guineas is not a very exorbitant price\nfor it now.”',
				'In a short time he had returned, and brought Mr Garwood with him.\nGarwood’s statement was to the effect that the figure, when he had seen\nit, was clear of the edge of the picture, but had not got far across the lawn.\nHe remembered a white mark on the back of its drapery, but could not have been\nsure it was a cross. A document to this effect was then drawn up and signed,\nand Nisbet proceeded to photograph the picture.',
				'“Now what do you mean to do?” he said. “Are you going to sit\nand watch it all day?”',
				'“Well, no, I think not,” said Williams. “I rather imagine\nwe’re meant to see the whole thing. You see, between the time I saw it\nlast night and this morning there was time for lots of things to happen, but\nthe creature only got into the house. It could easily have got through its\nbusiness in the time and gone to its own place again; but the fact of the\nwindow being open, I think, must mean that it’s in there now. So I feel\nquite easy about leaving it. And, besides, I have a kind of idea that it\nwouldn’t change much, if at all, in the daytime. We might go out for a\nwalk this afternoon, and come in to tea, or whenever it gets dark. I shall\nleave it out on the table here, and sport the door. My skip can get in, but no\none else.”',
				'The three agreed that this would be a good plan; and, further, that if they\nspent the afternoon together they would be less likely to talk about the\nbusiness to other people; for any rumour of such a transaction as was going on\nwould bring the whole of the Phasmatological Society about their ears.',
				'We may give them a respite until five o’clock.',
				'At or near that hour the three were entering Williams’s staircase. They\nwere at first slightly annoyed to see that the door of his rooms was unsported;\nbut in a moment it was remembered that on Sunday the skips came for orders an\nhour or so earlier than on weekdays. However, a surprise was awaiting them. The\nfirst thing they saw was the picture leaning up against a pile of books on the\ntable, as it had been left, and the next thing was Williams’s skip,\nseated on a chair opposite, gazing at it with undisguised horror. How was this?\nMr Filcher (the name is not my own invention) was a servant of considerable\nstanding, and set the standard of etiquette to all his own college and to\nseveral neighbouring ones, and nothing could be more alien to his practice than\nto be found sitting on his master’s chair, or appearing to take any\nparticular notice of his master’s furniture or pictures. Indeed, he\nseemed to feel this himself. He started violently when the three men were in\nthe room, and got up with a marked effort. Then he said:',
				'“I ask your pardon, sir, for taking such a freedom as to set down.”',
				'“Not at all, Robert,” interposed Mr Williams. “I was meaning\nto ask you some time what you thought of that picture.”',
				'“Well, sir, of course I don’t set up my opinion again yours, but it\nain’t the pictur I should ’ang where my little girl could see it,\nsir.”',
				'“Wouldn’t you, Robert? Why not?”',
				'“No, sir. Why, the pore child, I recollect once she see a Door Bible,\nwith pictures not ’alf what that is, and we ’ad to set up with her\nthree or four nights afterwards, if you’ll believe me; and if she was to\nketch a sight of this skelinton here, or whatever it is, carrying off the pore\nbaby, she would be in a taking. You know ’ow it is with children;\n’ow nervish they git with a little thing and all. But what I should say,\nit don’t seem a right pictur to be laying about, sir, not where anyone\nthat’s liable to be startled could come on it. Should you be wanting\nanything this evening, sir? Thank you, sir.”',
				'With these words the excellent man went to continue the round of his masters,\nand you may be sure the gentlemen whom he left lost no time in gathering round\nthe engraving. There was the house, as before, under the waning moon and the\ndrifting clouds. The window that had been open was shut, and the figure was\nonce more on the lawn: but not this time crawling cautiously on hands and\nknees. Now it was erect and stepping swiftly, with long strides, towards the\nfront of the picture. The moon was behind it, and the black drapery hung down\nover its face so that only hints of that could be seen, and what was visible\nmade the spectators profoundly thankful that they could see no more than a\nwhite dome-like forehead and a few straggling hairs. The head was bent down,\nand the arms were tightly clasped over an object which could be dimly seen and\nidentified as a child, whether dead or living it was not possible to say. The\nlegs of the appearance alone could be plainly discerned, and they were horribly\nthin.',
				'From five to seven the three companions sat and watched the picture by turns.\nBut it never changed. They agreed at last that it would be safe to leave it,\nand that they would return after Hall and await further developments.',
				'When they assembled again, at the earliest possible moment, the engraving was\nthere, but the figure was gone, and the house was quiet under the moonbeams.\nThere was nothing for it but to spend the evening over gazetteers and\nguide-books. Williams was the lucky one at last, and perhaps he deserved it. At\n11.30 p.m. he read from Murray’s Guide to Essex the following\nlines:',
				'16½ miles, Anningley. The church has been an interesting building\nof Norman date, but was extensively classicized in the last century. It\ncontains the tomb of the family of Francis, whose mansion, Anningley Hall, a\nsolid Queen Anne house, stands immediately beyond the churchyard in a park of\nabout 80 acres. The family is now extinct, the last heir having disappeared\nmysteriously in infancy in the year 1802. The father, Mr Arthur Francis, was\nlocally known as a talented amateur engraver in mezzotint. After his\nson’s disappearance he lived in complete retirement at the Hall, and was\nfound dead in his studio on the third anniversary of the disaster, having just\ncompleted an engraving of the house, impressions of which are of considerable\nrarity.',
				'This looked like business, and, indeed, Mr Green on his return at once\nidentified the house as Anningley Hall.',
				'“Is there any kind of explanation of the figure, Green?” was the\nquestion which Williams naturally asked.',
				'“I don’t know, I’m sure, Williams. What used to be said in\nthe place when I first knew it, which was before I came up here, was just this:\nold Francis was always very much down on these poaching fellows, and whenever\nhe got a chance he used to get a man whom he suspected of it turned off the\nestate, and by degrees he got rid of them all but one. Squires could do a lot\nof things then that they daren’t think of now. Well, this man that was\nleft was what you find pretty often in that country—the last remains of a\nvery old family. I believe they were Lords of the Manor at one time. I\nrecollect just the same thing in my own parish.”',
				'“What, like the man in Tess o’ the Durbervilles?”\nWilliams put in.',
				'“Yes, I dare say; it’s not a book I could ever read myself. But\nthis fellow could show a row of tombs in the church there that belonged to his\nancestors, and all that went to sour him a bit; but Francis, they said, could\nnever get at him—he always kept just on the right side of the\nlaw—until one night the keepers found him at it in a wood right at the\nend of the estate. I could show you the place now; it marches with some land\nthat used to belong to an uncle of mine. And you can imagine there was a row;\nand this man Gawdy (that was the name, to be sure—Gawdy; I thought I\nshould get it—Gawdy), he was unlucky enough, poor chap! to shoot a\nkeeper. Well, that was what Francis wanted, and grand juries—you know\nwhat they would have been then—and poor Gawdy was strung up in\ndouble-quick time; and I’ve been shown the place he was buried in, on the\nnorth side of the church—you know the way in that part of the world:\nanyone that’s been hanged or made away with themselves, they bury them\nthat side. And the idea was that some friend of Gawdy’s—not a\nrelation, because he had none, poor devil! he was the last of his line: kind of\nspes ultima gentis—must have planned to get hold of\nFrancis’s boy and put an end to his line, too. I don’t\nknow—it’s rather an out-of-the-way thing for an Essex poacher to\nthink of—but, you know, I should say now it looks more as if old Gawdy\nhad managed the job himself. Booh! I hate to think of it! have some whisky,\nWilliams!”',
				'The facts were communicated by Williams to Dennistoun, and by him to a mixed\ncompany, of which I was one, and the Sadducean Professor of Ophiology another.\nI am sorry to say that the latter, when asked what he thought of it, only\nremarked: “Oh, those Bridgeford people will say anything”—a\nsentiment which met with the reception it deserved.',
				'I have only to add that the picture is now in the Ashleian Museum; that it has\nbeen treated with a view to discovering whether sympathetic ink has been used\nin it, but without effect; that Mr Britnell knew nothing of it save that he was\nsure it was uncommon; and that, though carefully watched, it has never been\nknown to change again.',

			title: 'The Ash-tree',
			content: [
				'Everyone who has travelled over Eastern England knows the smaller\ncountry-houses with which it is studded—the rather dank little buildings,\nusually in the Italian style, surrounded with parks of some eighty to a hundred\nacres. For me they have always had a very strong attraction: with the grey\npaling of split oak, the noble trees, the meres with their reed-beds, and the\nline of distant woods. Then, I like the pillared portico—perhaps stuck on\nto a red-brick Queen Anne house which has been faced with stucco to bring it\ninto line with the “Grecian” taste of the end of the eighteenth\ncentury; the hall inside, going up to the roof, which hall ought always to be\nprovided with a gallery and a small organ. I like the library, too, where you\nmay find anything from a Psalter of the thirteenth century to a Shakespeare\nquarto. I like the pictures, of course; and perhaps most of all I like fancying\nwhat life in such a house was when it was first built, and in the piping times\nof landlords’ prosperity, and not least now, when, if money is not so\nplentiful, taste is more varied and life quite as interesting. I wish to have\none of these houses, and enough money to keep it together and entertain my\nfriends in it modestly.',
				'But this is a digression. I have to tell you of a curious series of events\nwhich happened in such a house as I have tried to describe. It is Castringham\nHall in Suffolk. I think a good deal has been done to the building since the\nperiod of my story, but the essential features I have sketched are still\nthere—Italian portico, square block of white house, older inside than\nout, park with fringe of woods, and mere. The one feature that marked out the\nhouse from a score of others is gone. As you looked at it from the park, you\nsaw on the right a great old ash-tree growing within half a dozen yards of the\nwall, and almost or quite touching the building with its branches. I suppose it\nhad stood there ever since Castringham ceased to be a fortified place, and\nsince the moat was filled in and the Elizabethan dwelling-house built. At any\nrate, it had well-nigh attained its full dimensions in the year 1690.',
				'In that year the district in which the Hall is situated was the scene of a\nnumber of witch-trials. It will be long, I think, before we arrive at a just\nestimate of the amount of solid reason—if there was any—which lay\nat the root of the universal fear of witches in old times. Whether the persons\naccused of this offence really did imagine that they were possessed of unusual\npower of any kind; or whether they had the will at least, if not the power, of\ndoing mischief to their neighbours; or whether all the confessions, of which\nthere are so many, were extorted by the mere cruelty of the\nwitch-finders—these are questions which are not, I fancy, yet solved. And\nthe present narrative gives me pause. I cannot altogether sweep it away as mere\ninvention. The reader must judge for himself.',
				'Castringham contributed a victim to the auto-da-fé. Mrs Mothersole was\nher name, and she differed from the ordinary run of village witches only in\nbeing rather better off and in a more influential position. Efforts were made\nto save her by several reputable farmers of the parish. They did their best to\ntestify to her character, and showed considerable anxiety as to the verdict of\nthe jury.',
				'But what seems to have been fatal to the woman was the evidence of the then\nproprietor of Castringham Hall—Sir Matthew Fell. He deposed to having\nwatched her on three different occasions from his window, at the full of the\nmoon, gathering sprigs “from the ash-tree near my house”. She had\nclimbed into the branches, clad only in her shift, and was cutting off small\ntwigs with a peculiarly curved knife, and as she did so she seemed to be\ntalking to herself. On each occasion Sir Matthew had done his best to capture\nthe woman, but she had always taken alarm at some accidental noise he had made,\nand all he could see when he got down to the garden was a hare running across\nthe path in the direction of the village.',
				'On the third night he had been at the pains to follow at his best speed, and\nhad gone straight to Mrs Mothersole’s house; but he had had to wait a\nquarter of an hour battering at her door, and then she had come out very cross,\nand apparently very sleepy, as if just out of bed; and he had no good\nexplanation to offer of his visit.',
				'Mainly on this evidence, though there was much more of a less striking and\nunusual kind from other parishioners, Mrs Mothersole was found guilty and\ncondemned to die. She was hanged a week after the trial, with five or six more\nunhappy creatures, at Bury St Edmunds.',
				'Sir Matthew Fell, then Deputy-Sheriff, was present at the execution. It was a\ndamp, drizzly March morning when the cart made its way up the rough grass hill\noutside Northgate, where the gallows stood. The other victims were apathetic or\nbroken down with misery; but Mrs Mothersole was, as in life so in death, of a\nvery different temper. Her “poysonous Rage”, as a reporter of the\ntime puts it, “did so work upon the Bystanders—yea, even upon the\nHangman—that it was constantly affirmed of all that saw her that she\npresented the living Aspect of a mad Divell. Yet she offer’d no\nResistance to the Officers of the Law; onely she looked upon those that laid\nHands upon her with so direfull and venomous an Aspect that—as one of\nthem afterwards assured me—the meer Thought of it preyed inwardly upon\nhis Mind for six Months after.”',
				'However, all that she is reported to have said was the seemingly meaningless\nwords: “There will be guests at the Hall.” Which she repeated more\nthan once in an undertone.',
				'Sir Matthew Fell was not unimpressed by the bearing of the woman. He had some\ntalk upon the matter with the Vicar of his parish, with whom he travelled home\nafter the assize business was over. His evidence at the trial had not been very\nwillingly given; he was not specially infected with the witch-finding mania,\nbut he declared, then and afterwards, that he could not give any other account\nof the matter than that he had given, and that he could not possibly have been\nmistaken as to what he saw. The whole transaction had been repugnant to him,\nfor he was a man who liked to be on pleasant terms with those about him; but he\nsaw a duty to be done in this business, and he had done it. That seems to have\nbeen the gist of his sentiments, and the Vicar applauded it, as any reasonable\nman must have done.',
				'A few weeks after, when the moon of May was at the full, Vicar and Squire met\nagain in the park, and walked to the Hall together. Lady Fell was with her\nmother, who was dangerously ill, and Sir Matthew was alone at home; so the\nVicar, Mr Crome, was easily persuaded to take a late supper at the Hall.',
				'Sir Matthew was not very good company this evening. The talk ran chiefly on\nfamily and parish matters, and, as luck would have it, Sir Matthew made a\nmemorandum in writing of certain wishes or intentions of his regarding his\nestates, which afterwards proved exceedingly useful.',
				'When Mr Crome thought of starting for home, about half past nine o’clock,\nSir Matthew and he took a preliminary turn on the gravelled walk at the back of\nthe house. The only incident that struck Mr Crome was this: they were in sight\nof the ash-tree which I described as growing near the windows of the building,\nwhen Sir Matthew stopped and said:',
				'“What is that that runs up and down the stem of the ash? It is never a\nsquirrel? They will all be in their nests by now.”',
				'The Vicar looked and saw the moving creature, but he could make nothing of its\ncolour in the moonlight. The sharp outline, however, seen for an instant, was\nimprinted on his brain, and he could have sworn, he said, though it sounded\nfoolish, that, squirrel or not, it had more than four legs.',
				'Still, not much was to be made of the momentary vision, and the two men parted.\nThey may have met since then, but it was not for a score of years.',
				'Next day Sir Matthew Fell was not downstairs at six in the morning, as was his\ncustom, nor at seven, nor yet at eight. Hereupon the servants went and knocked\nat his chamber door. I need not prolong the description of their anxious\nlistenings and renewed batterings on the panels. The door was opened at last\nfrom the outside, and they found their master dead and black. So much you have\nguessed. That there were any marks of violence did not at the moment appear;\nbut the window was open.',
				'One of the men went to fetch the parson, and then by his directions rode on to\ngive notice to the coroner. Mr Crome himself went as quick as he might to the\nHall, and was shown to the room where the dead man lay. He has left some notes\namong his papers which show how genuine a respect and sorrow was felt for Sir\nMatthew, and there is also this passage, which I transcribe for the sake of the\nlight it throws upon the course of events, and also upon the common beliefs of\nthe time:',
				'“There was not any the least Trace of an Entrance having been\nforc’d to the Chamber: but the Casement stood open, as my poor Friend\nwould always have it in this Season. He had his Evening Drink of small Ale in a\nsilver vessel of about a pint measure, and tonight had not drunk it out. This\nDrink was examined by the Physician from Bury, a Mr Hodgkins, who could not,\nhowever, as he afterwards declar’d upon his Oath, before the\nCoroner’s quest, discover that any matter of a venomous kind was present\nin it. For, as was natural, in the great Swelling and Blackness of the Corpse,\nthere was talk made among the Neighbours of Poyson. The Body was very much\nDisorder’d as it laid in the Bed, being twisted after so extream a sort\nas gave too probable Conjecture that my worthy Friend and Patron had\nexpir’d in great Pain and Agony. And what is as yet unexplain’d,\nand to myself the Argument of some Horrid and Artfull Designe in the\nPerpetrators of this Barbarous Murther, was this, that the Women which were\nentrusted with the laying-out of the Corpse and washing it, being both sad\nPersons and very well Respected in their Mournfull Profession, came to me in a\ngreat Pain and Distress both of Mind and Body, saying, what was indeed\nconfirmed upon the first View, that they had no sooner touch’d the Breast\nof the Corpse with their naked Hands than they were sensible of a more than\nordinary violent Smart and Acheing in their Palms, which, with their whole\nForearms, in no long time swell’d so immoderately, the Pain still\ncontinuing, that, as afterwards proved, during many weeks they were\nforc’d to lay by the exercise of their Calling; and yet no mark seen on\nthe Skin.',
				'“Upon hearing this, I sent for the Physician, who was still in the House,\nand we made as carefull a Proof as we were able by the Help of a small\nMagnifying Lens of Crystal of the condition of the Skinn on this Part of the\nBody: but could not detect with the Instrument we had any Matter of Importance\nbeyond a couple of small Punctures or Pricks, which we then concluded were the\nSpotts by which the Poyson might be introduced, remembering that Ring of\nPope Borgia, with other known Specimens of the Horrid Art of the Italian\nPoysoners of the last age.',
				'“So much is to be said of the Symptoms seen on the Corpse. As to what I\nam to add, it is meerly my own Experiment, and to be left to Posterity to judge\nwhether there be anything of Value therein. There was on the Table by the\nBeddside a Bible of the small size, in which my Friend—punctuall as in\nMatters of less Moment, so in this more weighty one—used nightly, and\nupon his First Rising, to read a sett Portion. And I taking it up—not\nwithout a Tear duly paid to him wich from the Study of this poorer Adumbration\nwas now pass’d to the contemplation of its great Originall—it came\ninto my Thoughts, as at such moments of Helplessness we are prone to catch at\nany the least Glimmer that makes promise of Light, to make trial of that old\nand by many accounted Superstitious Practice of drawing the Sortes; of\nwhich a Principall Instance, in the case of his late Sacred Majesty the Blessed\nMartyr King Charles and my Lord Falkland, was now much talked of.\nI must needs admit that by my Trial not much Assistance was afforded me: yet,\nas the Cause and Origin of these Dreadfull Events may hereafter be\nsearch’d out, I set down the Results, in the case it may be found that\nthey pointed the true Quarter of the Mischief to a quicker Intelligence than my\nown.',
				'“I made, then, three trials, opening the Book and placing my Finger upon\ncertain Words: which gave in the first these words, from Luke xiii. 7, Cut\nit down; in the second, Isaiah xiii. 20, It shall never be\ninhabited; and upon the third Experiment, Job xxxix. 30, Her young ones\nalso suck up blood.”',
				'This is all that need be quoted from Mr Crome’s papers. Sir Matthew Fell\nwas duly coffined and laid into the earth, and his funeral sermon, preached by\nMr Crome on the following Sunday, has been printed under the title of\n“The Unsearchable Way; or, England’s Danger and the Malicious\nDealings of Antichrist”, it being the Vicar’s view, as well as that\nmost commonly held in the neighbourhood, that the Squire was the victim of a\nrecrudescence of the Popish Plot.',
				'His son, Sir Matthew the second, succeeded to the title and estates. And so\nends the first act of the Castringham tragedy. It is to be mentioned, though\nthe fact is not surprising, that the new Baronet did not occupy the room in\nwhich his father had died. Nor, indeed, was it slept in by anyone but an\noccasional visitor during the whole of his occupation. He died in 1735, and I\ndo not find that anything particular marked his reign, save a curiously\nconstant mortality among his cattle and live-stock in general, which showed a\ntendency to increase slightly as time went on.',
				'Those who are interested in the details will find a statistical account in a\nletter to the Gentleman’s Magazine of 1772, which draws the facts\nfrom the Baronet’s own papers. He put an end to it at last by a very\nsimple expedient, that of shutting up all his beasts in sheds at night, and\nkeeping no sheep in his park. For he had noticed that nothing was ever attacked\nthat spent the night indoors. After that the disorder confined itself to wild\nbirds, and beasts of chase. But as we have no good account of the symptoms, and\nas all-night watching was quite unproductive of any clue, I do not dwell on\nwhat the Suffolk farmers called the “Castringham sickness”.',
				'The second Sir Matthew died in 1735, as I said, and was duly succeeded by his\nson, Sir Richard. It was in his time that the great family pew was built out on\nthe north side of the parish church. So large were the Squire’s ideas\nthat several of the graves on that unhallowed side of the building had to be\ndisturbed to satisfy his requirements. Among them was that of Mrs Mothersole,\nthe position of which was accurately known, thanks to a note on a plan of the\nchurch and yard, both made by Mr Crome.',
				'A certain amount of interest was excited in the village when it was known that\nthe famous witch, who was still remembered by a few, was to be exhumed. And the\nfeeling of surprise, and indeed disquiet, was very strong when it was found\nthat, though her coffin was fairly sound and unbroken, there was no trace\nwhatever inside it of body, bones, or dust. Indeed, it is a curious phenomenon,\nfor at the time of her burying no such things were dreamt of as\nresurrection-men, and it is difficult to conceive any rational motive for\nstealing a body otherwise than for the uses of the dissecting-room.',
				'The incident revived for a time all the stories of witch-trials and of the\nexploits of the witches, dormant for forty years, and Sir Richard’s\norders that the coffin should be burnt were thought by a good many to be rather\nfoolhardy, though they were duly carried out.',
				'Sir Richard was a pestilent innovator, it is certain. Before his time the Hall\nhad been a fine block of the mellowest red brick; but Sir Richard had travelled\nin Italy and become infected with the Italian taste, and, having more money\nthan his predecessors, he determined to leave an Italian palace where he had\nfound an English house. So stucco and ashlar masked the brick; some indifferent\nRoman marbles were planted about in the entrance-hall and gardens; a\nreproduction of the Sibyl’s temple at Tivoli was erected on the opposite\nbank of the mere; and Castringham took on an entirely new, and, I must say, a\nless engaging, aspect. But it was much admired, and served as a model to a good\nmany of the neighbouring gentry in after-years.',
				'One morning (it was in 1754) Sir Richard woke after a night of discomfort. It\nhad been windy, and his chimney had smoked persistently, and yet it was so cold\nthat he must keep up a fire. Also something had so rattled about the window\nthat no man could get a moment’s peace. Further, there was the prospect\nof several guests of position arriving in the course of the day, who would\nexpect sport of some kind, and the inroads of the distemper (which continued\namong his game) had been lately so serious that he was afraid for his\nreputation as a game-preserver. But what really touched him most nearly was the\nother matter of his sleepless night. He could certainly not sleep in that room\nagain.',
				'That was the chief subject of his meditations at breakfast, and after it he\nbegan a systematic examination of the rooms to see which would suit his notions\nbest. It was long before he found one. This had a window with an eastern aspect\nand that with a northern; this door the servants would be always passing, and\nhe did not like the bedstead in that. No, he must have a room with a western\nlook-out, so that the sun could not wake him early, and it must be out of the\nway of the business of the house. The housekeeper was at the end of her\nresources.',
				'“Well, Sir Richard,” she said, “you know that there is but\nthe one room like that in the house.”',
				'“Which may that be?” said Sir Richard.',
				'“And that is Sir Matthew’s—the West Chamber.”',
				'“Well, put me in there, for there I’ll lie tonight,” said her\nmaster. “Which way is it? Here, to be sure;” and he hurried off.',
				'“Oh, Sir Richard, but no one has slept there these forty years. The air\nhas hardly been changed since Sir Matthew died there.”',
				'Thus she spoke, and rustled after him.',
				'“Come, open the door, Mrs Chiddock. I’ll see the chamber, at\nleast.”',
				'So it was opened, and, indeed, the smell was very close and earthy. Sir Richard\ncrossed to the window, and, impatiently, as was his wont, threw the shutters\nback, and flung open the casement. For this end of the house was one which the\nalterations had barely touched, grown up as it was with the great ash-tree, and\nbeing otherwise concealed from view.',
				'“Air it, Mrs Chiddock, all today, and move my bed-furniture in in the\nafternoon. Put the Bishop of Kilmore in my old room.”',
				'“Pray, Sir Richard,” said a new voice, breaking in on this speech,\n“might I have the favour of a moment’s interview?”',
				'Sir Richard turned round and saw a man in black in the doorway, who bowed.',
				'“I must ask your indulgence for this intrusion, Sir Richard. You will,\nperhaps, hardly remember me. My name is William Crome, and my grandfather was\nVicar here in your grandfather’s time.”',
				'“Well, sir,” said Sir Richard, “the name of Crome is always a\npassport to Castringham. I am glad to renew a friendship of two\ngenerations” standing. In what can I serve you? for your hour of\ncalling—and, if I do not mistake you, your bearing—shows you to be\nin some haste.”',
				'“That is no more than the truth, sir. I am riding from Norwich to Bury St\nEdmunds with what haste I can make, and I have called in on my way to leave\nwith you some papers which we have but just come upon in looking over what my\ngrandfather left at his death. It is thought you may find some matters of\nfamily interest in them.”',
				'“You are mighty obliging, Mr Crome, and, if you will be so good as to\nfollow me to the parlour, and drink a glass of wine, we will take a first look\nat these same papers together. And you, Mrs Chiddock, as I said, be about\nairing this chamber…. Yes, it is here my grandfather died…. Yes, the tree,\nperhaps, does make the place a little dampish…. No; I do not wish to listen to\nany more. Make no difficulties, I beg. You have your orders—go. Will you\nfollow me, sir?”',
				'They went to the study. The packet which young Mr Crome had brought—he\nwas then just become a Fellow of Clare Hall in Cambridge, I may say, and\nsubsequently brought out a respectable edition of Polyaenus—contained\namong other things the notes which the old Vicar had made upon the occasion of\nSir Matthew Fell’s death. And for the first time Sir Richard was\nconfronted with the enigmatical Sortes Biblicæ which you have heard.\nThey amused him a good deal.',
				'“Well,” he said, “my grandfather’s Bible gave one\nprudent piece of advice—Cut it down. If that stands for the\nash-tree, he may rest assured I shall not neglect it. Such a nest of catarrhs\nand agues was never seen.”',
				'The parlour contained the family books, which, pending the arrival of a\ncollection which Sir Richard had made in Italy, and the building of a proper\nroom to receive them, were not many in number.',
				'Sir Richard looked up from the paper to the bookcase.',
				'“I wonder,” says he, “whether the old prophet is there yet? I\nfancy I see him.”',
				'Crossing the room, he took out a dumpy Bible, which, sure enough, bore on the\nflyleaf the inscription: “To Matthew Fell, from his Loving Godmother,\nAnne Aldous, 2 September, 1659.”',
				'“It would be no bad plan to test him again, Mr Crome. I will wager we get\na couple of names in the Chronicles. H’m! what have we here? ‘Thou\nshalt seek me in the morning, and I shall not be.’ Well, well! Your\ngrandfather would have made a fine omen of that, hey? No more prophets for me!\nThey are all in a tale. And now, Mr Crome, I am infinitely obliged to you for\nyour packet. You will, I fear, be impatient to get on. Pray allow\nme—another glass.”',
				'So with offers of hospitality, which were genuinely meant (for Sir Richard\nthought well of the young man’s address and manner), they parted.',
				'In the afternoon came the guests—the Bishop of Kilmore, Lady Mary Hervey,\nSir William Kentfield, etc. Dinner at five, wine, cards, supper, and dispersal\nto bed.',
				'Next morning Sir Richard is disinclined to take his gun with the rest. He talks\nwith the Bishop of Kilmore. This prelate, unlike a good many of the Irish\nBishops of his day, had visited his see, and, indeed, resided there, for some\nconsiderable time. This morning, as the two were walking along the terrace and\ntalking over the alterations and improvements in the house, the Bishop said,\npointing to the window of the West Room:',
				'“You could never get one of my Irish flock to occupy that room, Sir\nRichard.”',
				'“Why is that, my lord? It is, in fact, my own.”',
				'“Well, our Irish peasantry will always have it that it brings the worst\nof luck to sleep near an ash-tree, and you have a fine growth of ash not two\nyards from your chamber window. Perhaps,” the Bishop went on, with a\nsmile, “it has given you a touch of its quality already, for you do not\nseem, if I may say it, so much the fresher for your night’s rest as your\nfriends would like to see you.”',
				'“That, or something else, it is true, cost me my sleep from twelve to\nfour, my lord. But the tree is to come down tomorrow, so I shall not hear much\nmore from it.”',
				'“I applaud your determination. It can hardly be wholesome to have the air\nyou breathe strained, as it were, through all that leafage.”',
				'“Your lordship is right there, I think. But I had not my window open last\nnight. It was rather the noise that went on—no doubt from the twigs\nsweeping the glass—that kept me open-eyed.”',
				'“I think that can hardly be, Sir Richard. Here—you see it from this\npoint. None of these nearest branches even can touch your casement unless there\nwere a gale, and there was none of that last night. They miss the panes by a\nfoot.”',
				'“No, sir, true. What, then, will it be, I wonder, that scratched and\nrustled so—ay, and covered the dust on my sill with lines and\nmarks?”',
				'At last they agreed that the rats must have come up through the ivy. That was\nthe Bishop’s idea, and Sir Richard jumped at it.',
				'So the day passed quietly, and night came, and the party dispersed to their\nrooms, and wished Sir Richard a better night.',
				'And now we are in his bedroom, with the light out and the Squire in bed. The\nroom is over the kitchen, and the night outside still and warm, so the window\nstands open.',
				'There is very little light about the bedstead, but there is a strange movement\nthere; it seems as if Sir Richard were moving his head rapidly to and fro with\nonly the slightest possible sound. And now you would guess, so deceptive is the\nhalf-darkness, that he had several heads, round and brownish, which move back\nand forward, even as low as his chest. It is a horrible illusion. Is it nothing\nmore? There! something drops off the bed with a soft plump, like a kitten, and\nis out of the window in a flash; another—four—and after that there\nis quiet again.',
				'“Thou shalt seek me in the morning, and I shall not be.”',
				'As with Sir Matthew, so with Sir Richard—dead and black in his bed!',
				'A pale and silent party of guests and servants gathered under the window when\nthe news was known. Italian poisoners, Popish emissaries, infected\nair—all these and more guesses were hazarded, and the Bishop of Kilmore\nlooked at the tree, in the fork of whose lower boughs a white tom-cat was\ncrouching, looking down the hollow which years had gnawed in the trunk. It was\nwatching something inside the tree with great interest.',
				'Suddenly it got up and craned over the hole. Then a bit of the edge on which it\nstood gave way, and it went slithering in. Everyone looked up at the noise of\nthe fall.',
				'It is known to most of us that a cat can cry; but few of us have heard, I hope,\nsuch a yell as came out of the trunk of the great ash. Two or three screams\nthere were—the witnesses are not sure which—and then a slight and\nmuffled noise of some commotion or struggling was all that came. But Lady Mary\nHervey fainted outright, and the housekeeper stopped her ears and fled till she\nfell on the terrace.',
				'The Bishop of Kilmore and Sir William Kentfield stayed. Yet even they were\ndaunted, though it was only at the cry of a cat; and Sir William swallowed once\nor twice before he could say:',
				'“There is something more than we know of in that tree, my lord. I am for\nan instant search.”',
				'And this was agreed upon. A ladder was brought, and one of the gardeners went\nup, and, looking down the hollow, could detect nothing but a few dim\nindications of something moving. They got a lantern, and let it down by a rope.',
				'“We must get at the bottom of this. My life upon it, my lord, but the\nsecret of these terrible deaths is there.”',
				'Up went the gardener again with the lantern, and let it down the hole\ncautiously. They saw the yellow light upon his face as he bent over, and saw\nhis face struck with an incredulous terror and loathing before he cried out in\na dreadful voice and fell back from the ladder—where, happily, he was\ncaught by two of the men—letting the lantern fall inside the tree.',
				'He was in a dead faint, and it was some time before any word could be got from\nhim.',
				'By then they had something else to look at. The lantern must have broken at the\nbottom, and the light in it caught upon dry leaves and rubbish that lay there,\nfor in a few minutes a dense smoke began to come up, and then flame; and, to be\nshort, the tree was in a blaze.',
				'The bystanders made a ring at some yards’ distance, and Sir William and\nthe Bishop sent men to get what weapons and tools they could; for, clearly,\nwhatever might be using the tree as its lair would be forced out by the fire.',
				'So it was. First, at the fork, they saw a round body covered with\nfire—the size of a man’s head—appear very suddenly, then seem\nto collapse and fall back. This, five or six times; then a similar ball leapt\ninto the air and fell on the grass, where after a moment it lay still. The\nBishop went as near as he dared to it, and saw—what but the remains of an\nenormous spider, veinous and seared! And, as the fire burned lower down, more\nterrible bodies like this began to break out from the trunk, and it was seen\nthat these were covered with greyish hair.',
				'All that day the ash burned, and until it fell to pieces the men stood about\nit, and from time to time killed the brutes as they darted out. At last there\nwas a long interval when none appeared, and they cautiously closed in and\nexamined the roots of the tree.',
				'“They found,” says the Bishop of Kilmore, “below it a rounded\nhollow place in the earth, wherein were two or three bodies of these creatures\nthat had plainly been smothered by the smoke; and, what is to me more curious,\nat the side of this den, against the wall, was crouching the anatomy or\nskeleton of a human being, with the skin dried upon the bones, having some\nremains of black hair, which was pronounced by those that examined it to be\nundoubtedly the body of a woman, and clearly dead for a period of fifty\nyears.”',

			title: 'Number 13',
			content: [
				'Among the towns of Jutland, Viborg justly holds a high place. It is the seat of\na bishopric; it has a handsome but almost entirely new cathedral, a charming\ngarden, a lake of great beauty, and many storks. Near it is Hald, accounted one\nof the prettiest things in Denmark; and hard by is Finderup, where Marsk Stig\nmurdered King Erik Glipping on St Cecilia’s Day, in the year 1286.\nFifty-six blows of square-headed iron maces were traced on Erik’s skull\nwhen his tomb was opened in the seventeenth century. But I am not writing a\nguide-book.',
				'There are good hotels in Viborg—Preisler’s and the Phœnix are all\nthat can be desired. But my cousin, whose experiences I have to tell you now,\nwent to the Golden Lion the first time that he visited Viborg. He has not been\nthere since, and the following pages will, perhaps, explain the reason of his\nabstention.',
				'The Golden Lion is one of the very few houses in the town that were not\ndestroyed in the great fire of 1726, which practically demolished the\ncathedral, the Sognekirke, the Raadhuus, and so much else that was old and\ninteresting. It is a great red-brick house—that is, the front is of\nbrick, with corbie steps on the gables and a text over the door; but the\ncourtyard into which the omnibus drives is of black and white wood and plaster.',
				'The sun was declining in the heavens when my cousin walked up to the door, and\nthe light smote full upon the imposing façade of the house. He was delighted\nwith the old-fashioned aspect of the place, and promised himself a thoroughly\nsatisfactory and amusing stay in an inn so typical of old Jutland.',
				'It was not business in the ordinary sense of the word that had brought Mr\nAnderson to Viborg. He was engaged upon some researches into the Church history\nof Denmark, and it had come to his knowledge that in the Rigsarkiv of Viborg\nthere were papers, saved from the fire, relating to the last days of Roman\nCatholicism in the country. He proposed, therefore, to spend a considerable\ntime—perhaps as much as a fortnight or three weeks—in examining and\ncopying these, and he hoped that the Golden Lion would be able to give him a\nroom of sufficient size to serve alike as a bedroom and a study. His wishes\nwere explained to the landlord, and, after a certain amount of thought, the\nlatter suggested that perhaps it might be the best way for the gentleman to\nlook at one or two of the larger rooms and pick one for himself. It seemed a\ngood idea.',
				'The top floor was soon rejected as entailing too much getting upstairs after\nthe day’s work; the second floor contained no room of exactly the\ndimensions required; but on the first floor there was a choice of two or three\nrooms which would, so far as size went, suit admirably.',
				'The landlord was strongly in favour of Number 17, but Mr Anderson pointed out\nthat its windows commanded only the blank wall of the next house, and that it\nwould be very dark in the afternoon. Either Number 12 or Number 14 would be\nbetter, for both of them looked on the street, and the bright evening light and\nthe pretty view would more than compensate him for the additional amount of\nnoise.',
				'Eventually Number 12 was selected. Like its neighbours, it had three windows,\nall on one side of the room; it was fairly high and unusually long. There was,\nof course, no fireplace, but the stove was handsome and rather old—a\ncast-iron erection, on the side of which was a representation of Abraham\nsacrificing Isaac, and the inscription, “1 Bog Mose, Cap. 22,”\nabove. Nothing else in the room was remarkable; the only interesting picture\nwas an old coloured print of the town, date about 1820.',
				'Supper-time was approaching, but when Anderson, refreshed by the ordinary\nablutions, descended the staircase, there were still a few minutes before the\nbell rang. He devoted them to examining the list of his fellow-lodgers. As is\nusual in Denmark, their names were displayed on a large blackboard, divided\ninto columns and lines, the numbers of the rooms being painted in at the\nbeginning of each line. The list was not exciting. There was an advocate, or\nSagförer, a German, and some bagmen from Copenhagen. The one and only point\nwhich suggested any food for thought was the absence of any Number 13 from the\ntale of the rooms, and even this was a thing which Anderson had already noticed\nhalf a dozen times in his experience of Danish hotels. He could not help\nwondering whether the objection to that particular number, common as it is, was\nso widespread and so strong as to make it difficult to let a room so ticketed,\nand he resolved to ask the landlord if he and his colleagues in the profession\nhad actually met with many clients who refused to be accommodated in the\nthirteenth room.',
				'He had nothing to tell me (I am giving the story as I heard it from him) about\nwhat passed at supper, and the evening, which was spent in unpacking and\narranging his clothes, books, and papers, was not more eventful. Towards eleven\no’clock he resolved to go to bed, but with him, as with a good many other\npeople nowadays, an almost necessary preliminary to bed, if he meant to sleep,\nwas the reading of a few pages of print, and he now remembered that the\nparticular book which he had been reading in the train, and which alone would\nsatisfy him at that present moment, was in the pocket of his great-coat, then\nhanging on a peg outside the dining-room.',
				'To run down and secure it was the work of a moment, and, as the passages were\nby no means dark, it was not difficult for him to find his way back to his own\ndoor. So, at least, he thought; but when he arrived there, and turned the\nhandle, the door entirely refused to open, and he caught the sound of a hasty\nmovement towards it from within. He had tried the wrong door, of course. Was\nhis own room to the right or to the left? He glanced at the number: it was 13.\nHis room would be on the left; and so it was. And not before he had been in bed\nfor some minutes, had read his wonted three or four pages of his book, blown\nout his light, and turned over to go to sleep, did it occur to him that,\nwhereas on the blackboard of the hotel there had been no Number 13, there was\nundoubtedly a room numbered 13 in the hotel. He felt rather sorry he had not\nchosen it for his own. Perhaps he might have done the landlord a little service\nby occupying it, and given him the chance of saying that a well-born English\ngentleman had lived in it for three weeks and liked it very much. But probably\nit was used as a servant’s room or something of the kind. After all, it\nwas most likely not so large or good a room as his own. And he looked drowsily\nabout the room, which was fairly perceptible in the half-light from the\nstreet-lamp. It was a curious effect, he thought. Rooms usually look larger in\na dim light than a full one, but this seemed to have contracted in length and\ngrown proportionately higher. Well, well! sleep was more important than these\nvague ruminations—and to sleep he went.',
				'On the day after his arrival Anderson attacked the Rigsarkiv of Viborg. He was,\nas one might expect in Denmark, kindly received, and access to all that he\nwished to see was made as easy for him as possible. The documents laid before\nhim were far more numerous and interesting than he had at all anticipated.\nBesides official papers, there was a large bundle of correspondence relating to\nBishop Jörgen Friis, the last Roman Catholic who held the see, and in these\nthere cropped up many amusing and what are called “intimate”\ndetails of private life and individual character. There was much talk of a\nhouse owned by the Bishop, but not inhabited by him, in the town. Its tenant\nwas apparently somewhat of a scandal and a stumbling-block to the reforming\nparty. He was a disgrace, they wrote, to the city; he practised secret and\nwicked arts, and had sold his soul to the enemy. It was of a piece with the\ngross corruption and superstition of the Babylonish Church that such a viper\nand blood-sucking Troldmand should be patronized and harboured by the\nBishop. The Bishop met these reproaches boldly; he protested his own abhorrence\nof all such things as secret arts, and required his antagonists to bring the\nmatter before the proper court—of course, the spiritual court—and\nsift it to the bottom. No one could be more ready and willing than himself to\ncondemn Mag Nicolas Francken if the evidence showed him to have been guilty of\nany of the crimes informally alleged against him.',
				'Anderson had not time to do more than glance at the next letter of the\nProtestant leader, Rasmus Nielsen, before the record office was closed for the\nday, but he gathered its general tenor, which was to the effect that Christian\nmen were now no longer bound by the decisions of Bishops of Rome, and that the\nBishop’s Court was not, and could not be, a fit or competent tribunal to\njudge so grave and weighty a cause.',
				'On leaving the office, Mr Anderson was accompanied by the old gentleman who\npresided over it, and, as they walked, the conversation very naturally turned\nto the papers of which I have just been speaking.',
				'Herr Scavenius, the Archivist of Viborg, though very well informed as to the\ngeneral run of the documents under his charge, was not a specialist in those of\nthe Reformation period. He was much interested in what Anderson had to tell him\nabout them. He looked forward with great pleasure, he said, to seeing the\npublication in which Mr Anderson spoke of embodying their contents. “This\nhouse of the Bishop Friis,” he added, “it is a great puzzle to me\nwhere it can have stood. I have studied carefully the topography of old Viborg,\nbut it is most unlucky—of the old terrier of the Bishop’s property\nwhich was made in 1560, and of which we have the greater part in the\nArkiv, just the piece which had the list of the town property is missing. Never\nmind. Perhaps I shall some day succeed to find him.”',
				'After taking some exercise—I forget exactly how or where—Anderson\nwent back to the Golden Lion, his supper, his game of patience, and his bed. On\nthe way to his room it occurred to him that he had forgotten to talk to the\nlandlord about the omission of Number 13 from the hotel board, and also that he\nmight as well make sure that Number 13 did actually exist before he made any\nreference to the matter.',
				'The decision was not difficult to arrive at. There was the door with its number\nas plain as could be, and work of some kind was evidently going on inside it,\nfor as he neared the door he could hear footsteps and voices, or a voice,\nwithin. During the few seconds in which he halted to make sure of the number,\nthe footsteps ceased, seemingly very near the door, and he was a little\nstartled at hearing a quick hissing breathing as of a person in strong\nexcitement. He went on to his own room, and again he was surprised to find how\nmuch smaller it seemed now than it had when he selected it. It was a slight\ndisappointment, but only slight. If he found it really not large enough, he\ncould very easily shift to another. In the meantime he wanted\nsomething—as far as I remember it was a pocket-handkerchief—out of\nhis portmanteau, which had been placed by the porter on a very inadequate\ntrestle or stool against the wall at the farthest end of the room from his bed.\nHere was a very curious thing: the portmanteau was not to be seen. It had been\nmoved by officious servants; doubtless the contents had been put in the\nwardrobe. No, none of them were there. This was vexatious. The idea of a theft\nhe dismissed at once. Such things rarely happen in Denmark, but some piece of\nstupidity had certainly been performed (which is not so uncommon), and the\nstuepige must be severely spoken to. Whatever it was that he wanted, it\nwas not so necessary to his comfort that he could not wait till the morning for\nit, and he therefore settled not to ring the bell and disturb the servants. He\nwent to the window—the right-hand window it was—and looked out on\nthe quiet street. There was a tall building opposite, with large spaces of dead\nwall; no passers-by; a dark night; and very little to be seen of any kind.',
				'The light was behind him, and he could see his own shadow clearly cast on the\nwall opposite. Also the shadow of the bearded man in Number 11 on the left, who\npassed to and fro in shirtsleeves once or twice, and was seen first brushing\nhis hair, and later on in a nightgown. Also the shadow of the occupant of\nNumber 13 on the right. This might be more interesting. Number 13 was, like\nhimself, leaning on his elbows on the window-sill looking out into the street.\nHe seemed to be a tall thin man—or was it by any chance a woman?—at\nleast, it was someone who covered his or her head with some kind of drapery\nbefore going to bed, and, he thought, must be possessed of a red\nlamp-shade—and the lamp must be flickering very much. There was a\ndistinct playing up and down of a dull red light on the opposite wall. He\ncraned out a little to see if he could make any more of the figure, but beyond\na fold of some light, perhaps white, material on the window-sill he could see\nnothing.',
				'Now came a distant step in the street, and its approach seemed to recall Number\n13 to a sense of his exposed position, for very swiftly and suddenly he swept\naside from the window, and his red light went out. Anderson, who had been\nsmoking a cigarette, laid the end of it on the window-sill and went to bed.',
				'Next morning he was woken by the stuepige with hot water, etc. He roused\nhimself, and after thinking out the correct Danish words, said as distinctly as\nhe could:',
				'“You must not move my portmanteau. Where is it?”',
				'As is not uncommon, the maid laughed, and went away without making any distinct\nanswer.',
				'Anderson, rather irritated, sat up in bed, intending to call her back, but he\nremained sitting up, staring straight in front of him. There was his\nportmanteau on its trestle, exactly where he had seen the porter put it when he\nfirst arrived. This was a rude shock for a man who prided himself on his\naccuracy of observation. How it could possibly have escaped him the night\nbefore he did not pretend to understand; at any rate, there it was now.',
				'The daylight showed more than the portmanteau; it let the true proportions of\nthe room with its three windows appear, and satisfied its tenant that his\nchoice after all had not been a bad one. When he was almost dressed he walked\nto the middle one of the three windows to look out at the weather. Another\nshock awaited him. Strangely unobservant he must have been last night. He could\nhave sworn ten times over that he had been smoking at the right-hand window the\nlast thing before he went to bed, and here was his cigarette-end on the sill of\nthe middle window.',
				'He started to go down to breakfast. Rather late, but Number 13 was later: here\nwere his boots still outside his door—a gentleman’s boots. So then\nNumber 13 was a man, not a woman. Just then he caught sight of the number on\nthe door. It was 14. He thought he must have passed Number 13 without noticing\nit. Three stupid mistakes in twelve hours were too much for a methodical,\naccurate-minded man, so he turned back to make sure. The next number to 14 was\nnumber 12, his own room. There was no Number 13 at all.',
				'After some minutes devoted to a careful consideration of everything he had had\nto eat and drink during the last twenty-four hours, Anderson decided to give\nthe question up. If his eyes or his brain were giving way he would have plenty\nof opportunities for ascertaining that fact; if not, then he was evidently\nbeing treated to a very interesting experience. In either case the development\nof events would certainly be worth watching.',
				'During the day he continued his examination of the episcopal correspondence\nwhich I have already summarized. To his disappointment, it was incomplete. Only\none other letter could be found which referred to the affair of Mag Nicolas\nFrancken. It was from the Bishop Jörgen Friis to Rasmus Nielsen. He said:',
				'“Although we are not in the least degree inclined to assent to your\njudgement concerning our court, and shall be prepared if need be to withstand\nyou to the uttermost in that behalf, yet forasmuch as our trusty and\nwell-beloved Mag Nicolas Francken, against whom you have dared to allege\ncertain false and malicious charges, hath been suddenly removed from among us,\nit is apparent that the question for this time falls. But forasmuch as you\nfurther allege that the Apostle and Evangelist St John in his heavenly\nApocalypse describes the Holy Roman Church under the guise and symbol of the\nScarlet Woman, be it known to you,” etc.',
				'Search as he might, Anderson could find no sequel to this letter nor any clue\nto the cause or manner of the “removal” of the casus belli.\nHe could only suppose that Francken had died suddenly; and as there were only\ntwo days between the date of Nielsen’s last letter—when Francken\nwas evidently still in being—and that of the Bishop’s letter, the\ndeath must have been completely unexpected.',
				'In the afternoon he paid a short visit to Hald, and took his tea at Baekkelund;\nnor could he notice, though he was in a somewhat nervous frame of mind, that\nthere was any indication of such a failure of eye or brain as his experiences\nof the morning had led him to fear.',
				'At supper he found himself next to the landlord.',
				'“What,” he asked him, after some indifferent conversation,\n“is the reason why in most of the hotels one visits in this country the\nnumber thirteen is left out of the list of rooms? I see you have none\nhere.”',
				'The landlord seemed amused.',
				'“To think that you should have noticed a thing like that! I’ve\nthought about it once or twice myself, to tell the truth. An educated man,\nI’ve said, has no business with these superstitious notions. I was\nbrought up myself here in the high school of Viborg, and our old master was\nalways a man to set his face against anything of that kind. He’s been\ndead now this many years—a fine upstanding man he was, and ready with his\nhands as well as his head. I recollect us boys, one snowy day—”',
				'Here he plunged into reminiscence.',
				'“Then you don’t think there is any particular objection to having a\nNumber 13?” said Anderson.',
				'“Ah! to be sure. Well, you understand, I was brought up to the business\nby my poor old father. He kept an hotel in Aarhuus first, and then, when we\nwere born, he moved to Viborg here, which was his native place, and had the\nPhœnix here until he died. That was in 1876. Then I started business in\nSilkeborg, and only the year before last I moved into this house.”',
				'Then followed more details as to the state of the house and business when first\ntaken over.',
				'“And when you came here, was there a Number 13?”',
				'“No, no. I was going to tell you about that. You see, in a place like\nthis, the commercial class—the travellers—are what we have to\nprovide for in general. And put them in Number 13? Why, they’d as soon\nsleep in the street, or sooner. As far as I’m concerned myself, it\nwouldn’t make a penny difference to me what the number of my room was,\nand so I’ve often said to them; but they stick to it that it brings them\nbad luck. Quantities of stories they have among them of men that have slept in\na Number 13 and never been the same again, or lost their best customers,\nor—one thing and another,” said the landlord, after searching for a\nmore graphic phrase.',
				'“Then, what do you use your Number 13 for?” said Anderson,\nconscious as he said the words of a curious anxiety quite disproportionate to\nthe importance of the question.',
				'“My Number 13? Why, don’t I tell you that there isn’t such a\nthing in the house? I thought you might have noticed that. If there was it\nwould be next door to your own room.”',
				'“Well, yes; only I happened to think—that is, I fancied last night\nthat I had seen a door numbered thirteen in that passage; and, really, I am\nalmost certain I must have been right, for I saw it the night before as\nwell.”',
				'Of course, Herr Kristensen laughed this notion to scorn, as Anderson had\nexpected, and emphasized with much iteration the fact that no Number 13 existed\nor had existed before him in that hotel.',
				'Anderson was in some ways relieved by his certainty, but still puzzled, and he\nbegan to think that the best way to make sure whether he had indeed been\nsubject to an illusion or not was to invite the landlord to his room to smoke a\ncigar later on in the evening. Some photographs of English towns which he had\nwith him formed a sufficiently good excuse.',
				'Herr Kristensen was flattered by the invitation, and most willingly accepted\nit. At about ten o’clock he was to make his appearance, but before that\nAnderson had some letters to write, and retired for the purpose of writing\nthem. He almost blushed to himself at confessing it, but he could not deny that\nit was the fact that he was becoming quite nervous about the question of the\nexistence of Number 13; so much so that he approached his room by way of Number\n11, in order that he might not be obliged to pass the door, or the place where\nthe door ought to be. He looked quickly and suspiciously about the room when he\nentered it, but there was nothing, beyond that indefinable air of being smaller\nthan usual, to warrant any misgivings. There was no question of the presence or\nabsence of his portmanteau tonight. He had himself emptied it of its contents\nand lodged it under his bed. With a certain effort he dismissed the thought of\nNumber 13 from his mind, and sat down to his writing.',
				'His neighbours were quiet enough. Occasionally a door opened in the passage and\na pair of boots was thrown out, or a bagman walked past humming to himself, and\noutside, from time to time, a cart thundered over the atrocious cobble-stones,\nor a quick step hurried along the flags.',
				'Anderson finished his letters, ordered in whisky and soda, and then went to the\nwindow and studied the dead wall opposite and the shadows upon it.',
				'As far as he could remember, Number 14 had been occupied by the lawyer, a staid\nman, who said little at meals, being generally engaged in studying a small\nbundle of papers beside his plate. Apparently, however, he was in the habit of\ngiving vent to his animal spirits when alone. Why else should he be dancing?\nThe shadow from the next room evidently showed that he was. Again and again his\nthin form crossed the window, his arms waved, and a gaunt leg was kicked up\nwith surprising agility. He seemed to be barefooted, and the floor must be well\nlaid, for no sound betrayed his movements. Sagförer Herr Anders Jensen, dancing\nat ten o’clock at night in a hotel bedroom, seemed a fitting subject for\na historical painting in the grand style; and Anderson’s thoughts, like\nthose of Emily in the “Mysteries of Udolpho”, began to\n“arrange themselves in the following lines”:',
				'“When I return to my hotel,\n    At ten o’clock p.m.,\nThe waiters think I am unwell;\n    I do not care for them.\nBut when I’ve locked my chamber door,\n    And put my boots outside,\nI dance all night upon the floor.\nAnd even if my neighbours swore,\nI’d go on dancing all the more,\nFor I’m acquainted with the law,\nAnd in despite of all their jaw,\nTheir protests I deride.”',
				'Had not the landlord at this moment knocked at the door, it is probable that\nquite a long poem might have been laid before the reader. To judge from his\nlook of surprise when he found himself in the room, Herr Kristensen was struck,\nas Anderson had been, by something unusual in its aspect. But he made no\nremark. Anderson’s photographs interested him mightily, and formed the\ntext of many autobiographical discourses. Nor is it quite clear how the\nconversation could have been diverted into the desired channel of Number 13,\nhad not the lawyer at this moment begun to sing, and to sing in a manner which\ncould leave no doubt in anyone’s mind that he was either exceedingly\ndrunk or raving mad. It was a high, thin voice that they heard, and it seemed\ndry, as if from long disuse. Of words or tune there was no question. It went\nsailing up to a surprising height, and was carried down with a despairing moan\nas of a winter wind in a hollow chimney, or an organ whose wind fails suddenly.\nIt was a really horrible sound, and Anderson felt that if he had been alone he\nmust have fled for refuge and society to some neighbour bagman’s room.',
				'The landlord sat open-mouthed.',
				'“I don’t understand it,” he said at last, wiping his\nforehead. “It is dreadful. I have heard it once before, but I made sure\nit was a cat.”',
				'“Is he mad?” said Anderson.',
				'“He must be; and what a sad thing! Such a good customer, too, and so\nsuccessful in his business, by what I hear, and a young family to bring\nup.”',
				'Just then came an impatient knock at the door, and the knocker entered, without\nwaiting to be asked. It was the lawyer, in déshabille and very\nrough-haired; and very angry he looked.',
				'“I beg pardon, sir,” he said, “but I should be much obliged\nif you would kindly desist—”',
				'Here he stopped, for it was evident that neither of the persons before him was\nresponsible for the disturbance; and after a moment’s lull it swelled\nforth again more wildly than before.',
				'“But what in the name of Heaven does it mean?” broke out the\nlawyer. “Where is it? Who is it? Am I going out of my mind?”',
				'“Surely, Herr Jensen, it comes from your room next door? Isn’t\nthere a cat or something stuck in the chimney?”',
				'This was the best that occurred to Anderson to say, and he realized its\nfutility as he spoke; but anything was better than to stand and listen to that\nhorrible voice, and look at the broad, white face of the landlord, all\nperspiring and quivering as he clutched the arms of his chair.',
				'“Impossible,” said the lawyer, “impossible. There is no\nchimney. I came here because I was convinced the noise was going on here. It\nwas certainly in the next room to mine.”',
				'“Was there no door between yours and mine?” said Anderson eagerly.',
				'“No, sir,” said Herr Jensen, rather sharply. “At least, not\nthis morning.”',
				'“Ah!” said Anderson. “Nor tonight?”',
				'“I am not sure,” said the lawyer with some hesitation.',
				'Suddenly the crying or singing voice in the next room died away, and the singer\nwas heard seemingly to laugh to himself in a crooning manner. The three men\nactually shivered at the sound. Then there was a silence.',
				'“Come,” said the lawyer, “what have you to say, Herr\nKristensen? What does this mean?”',
				'“Good Heaven!” said Kristensen. “How should I tell! I know no\nmore than you, gentlemen. I pray I may never hear such a noise again.”',
				'“So do I,” said Herr Jensen, and he added something under his\nbreath. Anderson thought it sounded like the last words of the Psalter,\n“omnis spiritus laudet Dominum,” but he could not be sure.',
				'“But we must do something,” said Anderson—“the three of\nus. Shall we go and investigate in the next room?”',
				'“But that is Herr Jensen’s room,” wailed the landlord.\n“It is no use; he has come from there himself.”',
				'“I am not so sure,” said Jensen. “I think this gentleman is\nright: we must go and see.”',
				'The only weapons of defence that could be mustered on the spot were a stick and\numbrella. The expedition went out into the passage, not without quakings. There\nwas a deadly quiet outside, but a light shone from under the next door.\nAnderson and Jensen approached it. The latter turned the handle, and gave a\nsudden vigorous push. No use. The door stood fast.',
				'“Herr Kristensen,” said Jensen, “will you go and fetch the\nstrongest servant you have in the place? We must see this through.”',
				'The landlord nodded, and hurried off, glad to be away from the scene of action.\nJensen and Anderson remained outside looking at the door.',
				'“It is Number 13, you see,” said the latter.',
				'“Yes; there is your door, and there is mine,” said Jensen.',
				'“My room has three windows in the daytime,” said Anderson, with\ndifficulty suppressing a nervous laugh.',
				'“By George, so has mine!” said the lawyer, turning and looking at\nAnderson. His back was now to the door. In that moment the door opened, and an\narm came out and clawed at his shoulder. It was clad in ragged, yellowish\nlinen, and the bare skin, where it could be seen, had long grey hair upon it.',
				'Anderson was just in time to pull Jensen out of its reach with a cry of disgust\nand fright, when the door shut again, and a low laugh was heard.',
				'Jensen had seen nothing, but when Anderson hurriedly told him what a risk he\nhad run, he fell into a great state of agitation, and suggested that they\nshould retire from the enterprise and lock themselves up in one or other of\ntheir rooms.',
				'However, while he was developing this plan, the landlord and two able-bodied\nmen arrived on the scene, all looking rather serious and alarmed. Jensen met\nthem with a torrent of description and explanation, which did not at all tend\nto encourage them for the fray.',
				'The men dropped the crowbars they had brought, and said flatly that they were\nnot going to risk their throats in that devil’s den. The landlord was\nmiserably nervous and undecided, conscious that if the danger were not faced\nhis hotel was ruined, and very loth to face it himself. Luckily Anderson hit\nupon a way of rallying the demoralized force.',
				'“Is this,” he said, “the Danish courage I have heard so much\nof? It isn’t a German in there, and if it was, we are five to one.”',
				'The two servants and Jensen were stung into action by this, and made a dash at\nthe door.',
				'“Stop!” said Anderson. “Don’t lose your heads. You stay\nout here with the light, landlord, and one of you two men break in the door,\nand don’t go in when it gives way.”',
				'The men nodded, and the younger stepped forward, raised his crowbar, and dealt\na tremendous blow on the upper panel. The result was not in the least what any\nof them anticipated. There was no cracking or rending of wood—only a dull\nsound, as if the solid wall had been struck. The man dropped his tool with a\nshout, and began rubbing his elbow. His cry drew their eyes upon him for a\nmoment; then Anderson looked at the door again. It was gone; the plaster wall\nof the passage stared him in the face, with a considerable gash in it where the\ncrowbar had struck it. Number 13 had passed out of existence.',
				'For a brief space they stood perfectly still, gazing at the blank wall. An\nearly cock in the yard beneath was heard to crow; and as Anderson glanced in\nthe direction of the sound, he saw through the window at the end of the long\npassage that the eastern sky was paling to the dawn.',
				'“Perhaps,” said the landlord, with hesitation, “you gentlemen\nwould like another room for tonight—a double-bedded one?”',
				'Neither Jensen nor Anderson was averse to the suggestion. They felt inclined to\nhunt in couples after their late experience. It was found convenient, when each\nof them went to his room to collect the articles he wanted for the night, that\nthe other should go with him and hold the candle. They noticed that both Number\n12 and Number 14 had three windows.',
				'Next morning the same party reassembled in Number 12. The landlord was\nnaturally anxious to avoid engaging outside help, and yet it was imperative\nthat the mystery attaching to that part of the house should be cleared up.\nAccordingly the two servants had been induced to take upon them the function of\ncarpenters. The furniture was cleared away, and, at the cost of a good many\nirretrievably damaged planks, that portion of the floor was taken up which lay\nnearest to Number 14.',
				'You will naturally suppose that a skeleton—say that of Mag Nicolas\nFrancken—was discovered. That was not so. What they did find lying\nbetween the beams which supported the flooring was a small copper box. In it\nwas a neatly-folded vellum document, with about twenty lines of writing. Both\nAnderson and Jensen (who proved to be something of a palæographer) were much\nexcited by this discovery, which promised to afford the key to these\nextraordinary phenomena.',
				'I possess a copy of an astrological work which I have never read. It has, by\nway of frontispiece, a woodcut by Hans Sebald Beham, representing a number of\nsages seated round a table. This detail may enable connoisseurs to identify the\nbook. I cannot myself recollect its title, and it is not at this moment within\nreach; but the fly-leaves of it are covered with writing, and, during the ten\nyears in which I have owned the volume, I have not been able to determine which\nway up this writing ought to be read, much less in what language it is. Not\ndissimilar was the position of Anderson and Jensen after the protracted\nexamination to which they submitted the document in the copper box.',
				'After two days’ contemplation of it, Jensen, who was the bolder spirit of\nthe two, hazarded the conjecture that the language was either Latin or Old\nDanish.',
				'Anderson ventured upon no surmises, and was very willing to surrender the box\nand the parchment to the Historical Society of Viborg to be placed in their\nmuseum.',
				'I had the whole story from him a few months later, as we sat in a wood near\nUpsala, after a visit to the library there, where we—or, rather,\nI—had laughed over the contract by which Daniel Salthenius (in later life\nProfessor of Hebrew at Königsberg) sold himself to Satan. Anderson was not\nreally amused.',
				'“Young idiot!” he said, meaning Salthenius, who was only an\nundergraduate when he committed that indiscretion, “how did he know what\ncompany he was courting?”',
				'And when I suggested the usual considerations he only grunted. That same\nafternoon he told me what you have read; but he refused to draw any inferences\nfrom it, and to assent to any that I drew for him.',

			title: 'Count Magnus',
			content: [
				'By what means the papers out of which I have made a connected story came into\nmy hands is the last point which the reader will learn from these pages. But it\nis necessary to prefix to my extracts from them a statement of the form in\nwhich I possess them.',
				'They consist, then, partly of a series of collections for a book of travels,\nsuch a volume as was a common product of the forties and fifties. Horace\nMarryat’s Journal of a Residence in Jutland and the Danish Isles\nis a fair specimen of the class to which I allude. These books usually treated\nof some unknown district on the Continent. They were illustrated with woodcuts\nor steel plates. They gave details of hotel accommodation, and of means of\ncommunication, such as we now expect to find in any well-regulated guide-book,\nand they dealt largely in reported conversations with intelligent foreigners,\nracy innkeepers, and garrulous peasants. In a word, they were chatty.',
				'Begun with the idea of furnishing material for such a book, my papers as they\nprogressed assumed the character of a record of one single personal experience,\nand this record was continued up to the very eve, almost, of its termination.',
				'The writer was a Mr Wraxall. For my knowledge of him I have to depend entirely\non the evidence his writings afford, and from these I deduce that he was a man\npast middle age, possessed of some private means, and very much alone in the\nworld. He had, it seems, no settled abode in England, but was a denizen of\nhotels and boarding-houses. It is probable that he entertained the idea of\nsettling down at some future time which never came; and I think it also likely\nthat the Pantechnicon fire in the early seventies must have destroyed a great\ndeal that would have thrown light on his antecedents, for he refers once or\ntwice to property of his that was warehoused at that establishment.',
				'It is further apparent that Mr Wraxall had published a book, and that it\ntreated of a holiday he had once taken in Brittany. More than this I cannot say\nabout his work, because a diligent search in bibliographical works has\nconvinced me that it must have appeared either anonymously or under a\npseudonym.',
				'As to his character, it is not difficult to form some superficial opinion. He\nmust have been an intelligent and cultivated man. It seems that he was near\nbeing a Fellow of his college at Oxford—Brasenose, as I judge from the\nCalendar. His besetting fault was pretty clearly that of over-inquisitiveness,\npossibly a good fault in a traveller, certainly a fault for which this\ntraveller paid dearly enough in the end.',
				'On what proved to be his last expedition, he was plotting another book.\nScandinavia, a region not widely known to Englishmen forty years ago, had\nstruck him as an interesting field. He must have alighted on some old books of\nSwedish history or memoirs, and the idea had struck him that there was room for\na book descriptive of travel in Sweden, interspersed with episodes from the\nhistory of some of the great Swedish families. He procured letters of\nintroduction, therefore, to some persons of quality in Sweden, and set out\nthither in the early summer of 1863.',
				'Of his travels in the North there is no need to speak, nor of his residence of\nsome weeks in Stockholm. I need only mention that some savant resident\nthere put him on the track of an important collection of family papers\nbelonging to the proprietors of an ancient manor-house in Vestergothland, and\nobtained for him permission to examine them.',
				'The manor-house, or herrgård, in question is to be called Råbäck\n(pronounced something like Roebeck), though that is not its name. It is one of\nthe best buildings of its kind in all the country, and the picture of it in\nDahlenberg’s Suecia antiqua et moderna, engraved in 1694, shows it\nvery much as the tourist may see it today. It was built soon after 1600, and\nis, roughly speaking, very much like an English house of that period in respect\nof material—red-brick with stone facings—and style. The man who\nbuilt it was a scion of the great house of De la Gardie, and his descendants\npossess it still. De la Gardie is the name by which I will designate them when\nmention of them becomes necessary.',
				'They received Mr Wraxall with great kindness and courtesy, and pressed him to\nstay in the house as long as his researches lasted. But, preferring to be\nindependent, and mistrusting his powers of conversing in Swedish, he settled\nhimself at the village inn, which turned out quite sufficiently comfortable, at\nany rate during the summer months. This arrangement would entail a short walk\ndaily to and from the manor-house of something under a mile. The house itself\nstood in a park, and was protected—we should say grown up—with\nlarge old timber. Near it you found the walled garden, and then entered a close\nwood fringing one of the small lakes with which the whole country is pitted.\nThen came the wall of the demesne, and you climbed a steep knoll—a knob\nof rock lightly covered with soil—and on the top of this stood the\nchurch, fenced in with tall dark trees. It was a curious building to English\neyes. The nave and aisles were low, and filled with pews and galleries. In the\nwestern gallery stood the handsome old organ, gaily painted, and with silver\npipes. The ceiling was flat, and had been adorned by a seventeenth-century\nartist with a strange and hideous “Last Judgement”, full of lurid\nflames, falling cities, burning ships, crying souls, and brown and smiling\ndemons. Handsome brass coronae hung from the roof; the pulpit was like a\ndoll’s-house covered with little painted wooden cherubs and saints; a\nstand with three hour-glasses was hinged to the preacher’s desk. Such\nsights as these may be seen in many a church in Sweden now, but what\ndistinguished this one was an addition to the original building. At the eastern\nend of the north aisle the builder of the manor-house had erected a mausoleum\nfor himself and his family. It was a largish eight-sided building, lighted by a\nseries of oval windows, and it had a domed roof, topped by a kind of\npumpkin-shaped object rising into a spire, a form in which Swedish architects\ngreatly delighted. The roof was of copper externally, and was painted black,\nwhile the walls, in common with those of the church, were staringly white. To\nthis mausoleum there was no access from the church. It had a portal and steps\nof its own on the northern side.',
				'Past the churchyard the path to the village goes, and not more than three or\nfour minutes bring you to the inn door.',
				'On the first day of his stay at Råbäck Mr Wraxall found the church door open,\nand made those notes of the interior which I have epitomized. Into the\nmausoleum, however, he could not make his way. He could by looking through the\nkeyhole just descry that there were fine marble effigies and sarcophagi of\ncopper, and a wealth of armorial ornament, which made him very anxious to spend\nsome time in investigation.',
				'The papers he had come to examine at the manor-house proved to be of just the\nkind he wanted for his book. There were family correspondence, journals, and\naccount-books of the earliest owners of the estate, very carefully kept and\nclearly written, full of amusing and picturesque detail. The first De la Gardie\nappeared in them as a strong and capable man. Shortly after the building of the\nmansion there had been a period of distress in the district, and the peasants\nhad risen and attacked several châteaux and done some damage. The owner of\nRåbäck took a leading part in supressing the trouble, and there was reference\nto executions of ring-leaders and severe punishments inflicted with no sparing\nhand.',
				'The portrait of this Magnus de la Gardie was one of the best in the house, and\nMr Wraxall studied it with no little interest after his day’s work. He\ngives no detailed description of it, but I gather that the face impressed him\nrather by its power than by its beauty or goodness; in fact, he writes that\nCount Magnus was an almost phenomenally ugly man.',
				'On this day Mr Wraxall took his supper with the family, and walked back in the\nlate but still bright evening.',
				'“I must remember,” he writes, “to ask the sexton if he can\nlet me into the mausoleum at the church. He evidently has access to it himself,\nfor I saw him tonight standing on the steps, and, as I thought, locking or\nunlocking the door.”',
				'I find that early on the following day Mr Wraxall had some conversation with\nhis landlord. His setting it down at such length as he does surprised me at\nfirst; but I soon realized that the papers I was reading were, at least in\ntheir beginning, the materials for the book he was meditating, and that it was\nto have been one of those quasi-journalistic productions which admit of the\nintroduction of an admixture of conversational matter.',
				'His object, he says, was to find out whether any traditions of Count Magnus de\nla Gardie lingered on in the scenes of that gentleman’s activity, and\nwhether the popular estimate of him were favourable or not. He found that the\nCount was decidedly not a favourite. If his tenants came late to their work on\nthe days which they owed to him as Lord of the Manor, they were set on the\nwooden horse, or flogged and branded in the manor-house yard. One or two cases\nthere were of men who had occupied lands which encroached on the lord’s\ndomain, and whose houses had been mysteriously burnt on a winter’s night,\nwith the whole family inside. But what seemed to dwell on the innkeeper’s\nmind most—for he returned to the subject more than once—was that\nthe Count had been on the Black Pilgrimage, and had brought something or\nsomeone back with him.',
				'You will naturally inquire, as Mr Wraxall did, what the Black Pilgrimage may\nhave been. But your curiosity on the point must remain unsatisfied for the time\nbeing, just as his did. The landlord was evidently unwilling to give a full\nanswer, or indeed any answer, on the point, and, being called out for a moment,\ntrotted out with obvious alacrity, only putting his head in at the door a few\nminutes afterwards to say that he was called away to Skara, and should not be\nback till evening.',
				'So Mr Wraxall had to go unsatisfied to his day’s work at the manor-house.\nThe papers on which he was just then engaged soon put his thoughts into another\nchannel, for he had to occupy himself with glancing over the correspondence\nbetween Sophia Albertina in Stockholm and her married cousin Ulrica Leonora at\nRåbäck in the years 1705-1710. The letters were of exceptional interest from\nthe light they threw upon the culture of that period in Sweden, as anyone can\ntestify who has read the full edition of them in the publications of the\nSwedish Historical Manuscripts Commission.',
				'In the afternoon he had done with these, and after returning the boxes in which\nthey were kept to their places on the shelf, he proceeded, very naturally, to\ntake down some of the volumes nearest to them, in order to determine which of\nthem had best be his principal subject of investigation next day. The shelf he\nhad hit upon was occupied mostly by a collection of account-books in the\nwriting of the first Count Magnus. But one among them was not an account-book,\nbut a book of alchemical and other tracts in another sixteenth-century hand.\nNot being very familiar with alchemical literature, Mr Wraxall spends much\nspace which he might have spared in setting out the names and beginnings of the\nvarious treatises: The book of the Phœnix, book of the Thirty Words, book of\nthe Toad, book of Miriam, Turba philosophorum, and so forth; and then he\nannounces with a good deal of circumstance his delight at finding, on a leaf\noriginally left blank near the middle of the book, some writing of Count Magnus\nhimself headed “Liber nigræ peregrinationis”. It is true that only\na few lines were written, but there was quite enough to show that the landlord\nhad that morning been referring to a belief at least as old as the time of\nCount Magnus, and probably shared by him. This is the English of what was\nwritten:',
				'“If any man desires to obtain a long life, if he would obtain a faithful\nmessenger and see the blood of his enemies, it is necessary that he should\nfirst go into the city of Chorazin, and there salute the prince….” Here\nthere was an erasure of one word, not very thoroughly done, so that Mr Wraxall\nfelt pretty sure that he was right in reading it as aëris (“of the\nair”). But there was no more of the text copied, only a line in Latin:\nQuære reliqua hujus materiei inter secretiora. (See the rest of this\nmatter among the more private things.)',
				'It could not be denied that this threw a rather lurid light upon the tastes and\nbeliefs of the Count; but to Mr Wraxall, separated from him by nearly three\ncenturies, the thought that he might have added to his general forcefulness\nalchemy, and to alchemy something like magic, only made him a more picturesque\nfigure; and when, after a rather prolonged contemplation of his picture in the\nhall, Mr Wraxall set out on his homeward way, his mind was full of the thought\nof Count Magnus. He had no eyes for his surroundings, no perception of the\nevening scents of the woods or the evening light on the lake; and when all of a\nsudden he pulled up short, he was astonished to find himself already at the\ngate of the churchyard, and within a few minutes of his dinner. His eyes fell\non the mausoleum.',
				'“Ah,” he said, “Count Magnus, there you are. I should dearly\nlike to see you.”',
				'“Like many solitary men,” he writes, “I have a habit of\ntalking to myself aloud; and, unlike some of the Greek and Latin particles, I\ndo not expect an answer. Certainly, and perhaps fortunately in this case, there\nwas neither voice nor any that regarded: only the woman who, I suppose, was\ncleaning up the church, dropped some metallic object on the floor, whose clang\nstartled me. Count Magnus, I think, sleeps sound enough.”',
				'That same evening the landlord of the inn, who had heard Mr Wraxall say that he\nwished to see the clerk or deacon (as he would be called in Sweden) of the\nparish, introduced him to that official in the inn parlour. A visit to the De\nla Gardie tomb-house was soon arranged for the next day, and a little general\nconversation ensued.',
				'Mr Wraxall, remembering that one function of Scandinavian deacons is to teach\ncandidates for Confirmation, thought he would refresh his own memory on a\nBiblical point.',
				'“Can you tell me,” he said, “anything about Chorazin?”',
				'The deacon seemed startled, but readily reminded him how that village had once\nbeen denounced.',
				'“To be sure,” said Mr Wraxall; “it is, I suppose, quite a\nruin now?”',
				'“So I expect,” replied the deacon. “I have heard some of our\nold priests say that Antichrist is to be born there; and there are\ntales—”',
				'“Ah! what tales are those?” Mr Wraxall put in.',
				'“Tales, I was going to say, which I have forgotten,” said the\ndeacon; and soon after that he said good night.',
				'The landlord was now alone, and at Mr Wraxall’s mercy; and that inquirer\nwas not inclined to spare him.',
				'“Herr Nielsen,” he said, “I have found out something about\nthe Black Pilgrimage. You may as well tell me what you know. What did the Count\nbring back with him?”',
				'Swedes are habitually slow, perhaps, in answering, or perhaps the landlord was\nan exception. I am not sure; but Mr Wraxall notes that the landlord spent at\nleast one minute in looking at him before he said anything at all. Then he came\nclose up to his guest, and with a good deal of effort he spoke:',
				'“Mr Wraxall, I can tell you this one little tale, and no more—not\nany more. You must not ask anything when I have done. In my grandfather’s\ntime—that is, ninety-two years ago—there were two men who said:\n‘The Count is dead; we do not care for him. We will go tonight and have a\nfree hunt in his wood’—the long wood on the hill that you have seen\nbehind Råbäck. Well, those that heard them say this, they said: ‘No, do\nnot go; we are sure you will meet with persons walking who should not be\nwalking. They should be resting, not walking.’ These men laughed. There\nwere no forestmen to keep the wood, because no one wished to live there. The\nfamily were not here at the house. These men could do what they wished.',
				'“Very well, they go to the wood that night. My grandfather was sitting\nhere in this room. It was the summer, and a light night. With the window open,\nhe could see out to the wood, and hear.',
				'“So he sat there, and two or three men with him, and they listened. At\nfirst they hear nothing at all; then they hear someone—you know how far\naway it is—they hear someone scream, just as if the most inside part of\nhis soul was twisted out of him. All of them in the room caught hold of each\nother, and they sat so for three-quarters of an hour. Then they hear someone\nelse, only about three hundred ells off. They hear him laugh out loud: it was\nnot one of those two men that laughed, and, indeed, they have all of them said\nthat it was not any man at all. After that they hear a great door shut.',
				'“Then, when it was just light with the sun, they all went to the priest.\nThey said to him:',
				'“‘Father, put on your gown and your ruff, and come to bury these\nmen, Anders Bjornsen and Hans Thorbjorn.’',
				'“You understand that they were sure these men were dead. So they went to\nthe wood—my grandfather never forgot this. He said they were all like so\nmany dead men themselves. The priest, too, he was in a white fear. He said when\nthey came to him:',
				'“‘I heard one cry in the night, and I heard one laugh afterwards.\nIf I cannot forget that, I shall not be able to sleep again.’',
				'“So they went to the wood, and they found these men on the edge of the\nwood. Hans Thorbjorn was standing with his back against a tree, and all the\ntime he was pushing with his hands—pushing something away from him which\nwas not there. So he was not dead. And they led him away, and took him to the\nhouse at Nykjoping, and he died before the winter; but he went on pushing with\nhis hands. Also Anders Bjornsen was there; but he was dead. And I tell you this\nabout Anders Bjornsen, that he was once a beautiful man, but now his face was\nnot there, because the flesh of it was sucked away off the bones. You\nunderstand that? My grandfather did not forget that. And they laid him on the\nbier which they brought, and they put a cloth over his head, and the priest\nwalked before; and they began to sing the psalm for the dead as well as they\ncould. So, as they were singing the end of the first verse, one fell down, who\nwas carrying the head of the bier, and the others looked back, and they saw\nthat the cloth had fallen off, and the eyes of Anders Bjornsen were looking up,\nbecause there was nothing to close over them. And this they could not bear.\nTherefore the priest laid the cloth upon him, and sent for a spade, and they\nburied him in that place.”',
				'The next day Mr Wraxall records that the deacon called for him soon after his\nbreakfast, and took him to the church and mausoleum. He noticed that the key of\nthe latter was hung on a nail just by the pulpit, and it occurred to him that,\nas the church door seemed to be left unlocked as a rule, it would not be\ndifficult for him to pay a second and more private visit to the monuments if\nthere proved to be more of interest among them than could be digested at first.\nThe building, when he entered it, he found not unimposing. The monuments,\nmostly large erections of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, were\ndignified if luxuriant, and the epitaphs and heraldry were copious. The central\nspace of the domed room was occupied by three copper sarcophagi, covered with\nfinely-engraved ornament. Two of them had, as is commonly the case in Denmark\nand Sweden, a large metal crucifix on the lid. The third, that of Count Magnus,\nas it appeared, had, instead of that, a full-length effigy engraved upon it,\nand round the edge were several bands of similar ornament representing various\nscenes. One was a battle, with cannon belching out smoke, and walled towns, and\ntroops of pikemen. Another showed an execution. In a third, among trees, was a\nman running at full speed, with flying hair and outstretched hands. After him\nfollowed a strange form; it would be hard to say whether the artist had\nintended it for a man, and was unable to give the requisite similitude, or\nwhether it was intentionally made as monstrous as it looked. In view of the\nskill with which the rest of the drawing was done, Mr Wraxall felt inclined to\nadopt the latter idea. The figure was unduly short, and was for the most part\nmuffled in a hooded garment which swept the ground. The only part of the form\nwhich projected from that shelter was not shaped like any hand or arm. Mr\nWraxall compares it to the tentacle of a devil-fish, and continues: “On\nseeing this, I said to myself, ‘This, then, which is evidently an\nallegorical representation of some kind—a fiend pursuing a hunted\nsoul—may be the origin of the story of Count Magnus and his mysterious\ncompanion. Let us see how the huntsman is pictured: doubtless it will be a\ndemon blowing his horn.”’ But, as it turned out, there was no such\nsensational figure, only the semblance of a cloaked man on a hillock, who stood\nleaning on a stick, and watching the hunt with an interest which the engraver\nhad tried to express in his attitude.',
				'Mr Wraxall noted the finely-worked and massive steel padlocks—three in\nnumber—which secured the sarcophagus. One of them, he saw, was detached,\nand lay on the pavement. And then, unwilling to delay the deacon longer or to\nwaste his own working-time, he made his way onward to the manor-house.',
				'“It is curious,” he notes, “how, on retracing a familiar\npath, one’s thoughts engross one to the absolute exclusion of surrounding\nobjects. Tonight, for the second time, I had entirely failed to notice where I\nwas going (I had planned a private visit to the tomb-house to copy the\nepitaphs), when I suddenly, as it were, awoke to consciousness, and found\nmyself (as before) turning in at the churchyard gate, and, I believe, singing\nor chanting some such words as, ‘Are you awake, Count Magnus? Are you\nasleep, Count Magnus?’ and then something more which I have failed to\nrecollect. It seemed to me that I must have been behaving in this nonsensical\nway for some time.”',
				'He found the key of the mausoleum where he had expected to find it, and copied\nthe greater part of what he wanted; in fact, he stayed until the light began to\nfail him.',
				'“I must have been wrong,” he writes, “in saying that one of\nthe padlocks of my Count’s sarcophagus was unfastened; I see tonight that\ntwo are loose. I picked both up, and laid them carefully on the window-ledge,\nafter trying unsuccessfully to close them. The remaining one is still firm,\nand, though I take it to be a spring lock, I cannot guess how it is opened. Had\nI succeeded in undoing it, I am almost afraid I should have taken the liberty\nof opening the sarcophagus. It is strange, the interest I feel in the\npersonality of this, I fear, somewhat ferocious and grim old noble.”',
				'The day following was, as it turned out, the last of Mr Wraxall’s stay at\nRåbäck. He received letters connected with certain investments which made it\ndesirable that he should return to England; his work among the papers was\npractically done, and travelling was slow. He decided, therefore, to make his\nfarewells, put some finishing touches to his notes, and be off.',
				'These finishing touches and farewells, as it turned out, took more time than he\nhad expected. The hospitable family insisted on his staying to dine with\nthem—they dined at three—and it was verging on half past six before\nhe was outside the iron gates of Råbäck. He dwelt on every step of his walk by\nthe lake, determined to saturate himself, now that he trod it for the last\ntime, in the sentiment of the place and hour. And when he reached the summit of\nthe churchyard knoll, he lingered for many minutes, gazing at the limitless\nprospect of woods near and distant, all dark beneath a sky of liquid green.\nWhen at last he turned to go, the thought struck him that surely he must bid\nfarewell to Count Magnus as well as the rest of the De la Gardies. The church\nwas but twenty yards away, and he knew where the key of the mausoleum hung. It\nwas not long before he was standing over the great copper coffin, and, as\nusual, talking to himself aloud. “You may have been a bit of a rascal in\nyour time, Magnus,” he was saying, “but for all that I should like\nto see you, or, rather—”',
				'“Just at that instant,” he says, “I felt a blow on my foot.\nHastily enough I drew it back, and something fell on the pavement with a clash.\nIt was the third, the last of the three padlocks which had fastened the\nsarcophagus. I stooped to pick it up, and—Heaven is my witness that I am\nwriting only the bare truth—before I had raised myself there was a sound\nof metal hinges creaking, and I distinctly saw the lid shifting upwards. I may\nhave behaved like a coward, but I could not for my life stay for one moment. I\nwas outside that dreadful building in less time than I can write—almost\nas quickly as I could have said—the words; and what frightens me yet\nmore, I could not turn the key in the lock. As I sit here in my room noting\nthese facts, I ask myself (it was not twenty minutes ago) whether that noise of\ncreaking metal continued, and I cannot tell whether it did or not. I only know\nthat there was something more than I have written that alarmed me, but whether\nit was sound or sight I am not able to remember. What is this that I have\ndone?”',
				'Poor Mr Wraxall! He set out on his journey to England on the next day, as he\nhad planned, and he reached England in safety; and yet, as I gather from his\nchanged hand and inconsequent jottings, a broken man. One of several small\nnote-books that have come to me with his papers gives, not a key to, but a kind\nof inkling of, his experiences. Much of his journey was made by canal-boat, and\nI find not less than six painful attempts to enumerate and describe his\nfellow-passengers. The entries are of this kind:',
				'24. Pastor of village in Skåne. Usual black coat and soft black hat.\n25. Commercial traveller from Stockholm going to Trollhättan. Black cloak,\nbrown hat.\n26. Man in long black cloak, broad-leafed hat, very old-fashioned.',
				'This entry is lined out, and a note added: “Perhaps identical with No.\n13. Have not yet seen his face.” On referring to No. 13, I find that he\nis a Roman priest in a cassock.',
				'The net result of the reckoning is always the same. Twenty-eight people appear\nin the enumeration, one being always a man in a long black cloak and broad hat,\nand another a “short figure in dark cloak and hood”. On the other\nhand, it is always noted that only twenty-six passengers appear at meals, and\nthat the man in the cloak is perhaps absent, and the short figure is certainly\nabsent.',
				'On reaching England, it appears that Mr Wraxall landed at Harwich, and that he\nresolved at once to put himself out of the reach of some person or persons whom\nhe never specifies, but whom he had evidently come to regard as his pursuers.\nAccordingly he took a vehicle—it was a closed fly—not trusting the\nrailway and drove across country to the village of Belchamp St Paul. It was\nabout nine o’clock on a moonlight August night when he neared the place.\nHe was sitting forward, and looking out of the window at the fields and\nthickets—there was little else to be seen—racing past him. Suddenly\nhe came to a cross-road. At the corner two figures were standing motionless;\nboth were in dark cloaks; the taller one wore a hat, the shorter a hood. He had\nno time to see their faces, nor did they make any motion that he could discern.\nYet the horse shied violently and broke into a gallop, and Mr Wraxall sank back\ninto his seat in something like desperation. He had seen them before.',
				'Arrived at Belchamp St Paul, he was fortunate enough to find a decent furnished\nlodging, and for the next twenty-four hours he lived, comparatively speaking,\nin peace. His last notes were written on this day. They are too disjointed and\nejaculatory to be given here in full, but the substance of them is clear\nenough. He is expecting a visit from his pursuers—how or when he knows\nnot—and his constant cry is “What has he done?” and “Is\nthere no hope?” Doctors, he knows, would call him mad, policemen would\nlaugh at him. The parson is away. What can he do but lock his door and cry to\nGod?',
				'People still remembered last year at Belchamp St Paul how a strange gentleman\ncame one evening in August years back; and how the next morning but one he was\nfound dead, and there was an inquest; and the jury that viewed the body\nfainted, seven of ’em did, and none of ’em wouldn’t speak to\nwhat they see, and the verdict was visitation of God; and how the people as\nkep’ the ’ouse moved out that same week, and went away from that\npart. But they do not, I think, know that any glimmer of light has ever been\nthrown, or could be thrown, on the mystery. It so happened that last year the\nlittle house came into my hands as part of a legacy. It had stood empty since\n1863, and there seemed no prospect of letting it; so I had it pulled down, and\nthe papers of which I have given you an abstract were found in a forgotten\ncupboard under the window in the best bedroom.',

				'“I suppose you will be getting away pretty soon, now Full Term is over,\nProfessor,” said a person not in the story to the Professor of\nOntography, soon after they had sat down next to each other at a feast in the\nhospitable hall of St James’s College.',
				'The Professor was young, neat, and precise in speech.',
				'“Yes,” he said; “my friends have been making me take up golf\nthis term, and I mean to go to the East Coast—in point of fact to\nBurnstow—(I dare say you know it) for a week or ten days, to improve my\ngame. I hope to get off tomorrow.”',
				'“Oh, Parkins,” said his neighbour on the other side, “if you\nare going to Burnstow, I wish you would look at the site of the Templars’\npreceptory, and let me know if you think it would be any good to have a dig\nthere in the summer.”',
				'It was, as you might suppose, a person of antiquarian pursuits who said this,\nbut, since he merely appears in this prologue, there is no need to give his\nentitlements.',
				'“Certainly,” said Parkins, the Professor: “if you will\ndescribe to me whereabouts the site is, I will do my best to give you an idea\nof the lie of the land when I get back; or I could write to you about it, if\nyou would tell me where you are likely to be.”',
				'“Don’t trouble to do that, thanks. It’s only that I’m\nthinking of taking my family in that direction in the Long, and it occurred to\nme that, as very few of the English preceptories have ever been properly\nplanned, I might have an opportunity of doing something useful on\noff-days.”',
				'The Professor rather sniffed at the idea that planning out a preceptory could\nbe described as useful. His neighbour continued:',
				'“The site—I doubt if there is anything showing above\nground—must be down quite close to the beach now. The sea has encroached\ntremendously, as you know, all along that bit of coast. I should think, from\nthe map, that it must be about three-quarters of a mile from the Globe Inn, at\nthe north end of the town. Where are you going to stay?”',
				'“Well, at the Globe Inn, as a matter of fact,” said Parkins;\n“I have engaged a room there. I couldn’t get in anywhere else; most\nof the lodging-houses are shut up in winter, it seems; and, as it is, they tell\nme that the only room of any size I can have is really a double-bedded one, and\nthat they haven’t a corner in which to store the other bed, and so on.\nBut I must have a fairly large room, for I am taking some books down, and mean\nto do a bit of work; and though I don’t quite fancy having an empty\nbed—not to speak of two—in what I may call for the time being my\nstudy, I suppose I can manage to rough it for the short time I shall be\nthere.”',
				'“Do you call having an extra bed in your room roughing it,\nParkins?” said a bluff person opposite. “Look here, I shall come\ndown and occupy it for a bit; it’ll be company for you.”',
				'The Professor quivered, but managed to laugh in a courteous manner.',
				'“By all means, Rogers; there’s nothing I should like better. But\nI’m afraid you would find it rather dull; you don’t play golf, do\nyou?”',
				'“No, thank Heaven!” said rude Mr Rogers.',
				'“Well, you see, when I’m not writing I shall most likely be out on\nthe links, and that, as I say, would be rather dull for you, I’m\nafraid.”',
				'“Oh, I don’t know! There’s certain to be somebody I know in\nthe place; but, of course, if you don’t want me, speak the word, Parkins;\nI shan’t be offended. Truth, as you always tell us, is never\noffensive.”',
				'Parkins was, indeed, scrupulously polite and strictly truthful. It is to be\nfeared that Mr Rogers sometimes practised upon his knowledge of these\ncharacteristics. In Parkins’s breast there was a conflict now raging,\nwhich for a moment or two did not allow him to answer. That interval being\nover, he said:',
				'“Well, if you want the exact truth, Rogers, I was considering whether the\nroom I speak of would really be large enough to accommodate us both\ncomfortably; and also whether (mind, I shouldn’t have said this if you\nhadn’t pressed me) you would not constitute something in the nature of a\nhindrance to my work.”',
				'Rogers laughed loudly.',
				'“Well done, Parkins!” he said. “It’s all right. I\npromise not to interrupt your work; don’t you disturb yourself about\nthat. No, I won’t come if you don’t want me; but I thought I should\ndo so nicely to keep the ghosts off.” Here he might have been seen to\nwink and to nudge his next neighbour. Parkins might also have been seen to\nbecome pink. “I beg pardon, Parkins,” Rogers continued; “I\noughtn’t to have said that. I forgot you didn’t like levity on\nthese topics.”',
				'“Well,” Parkins said, “as you have mentioned the matter, I\nfreely own that I do not like careless talk about what you call ghosts.\nA man in my position,” he went on, raising his voice a little,\n“cannot, I find, be too careful about appearing to sanction the current\nbeliefs on such subjects. As you know, Rogers, or as you ought to know; for I\nthink I have never concealed my views—”',
				'“No, you certainly have not, old man,” put in Rogers sotto\nvoce.',
				'“—I hold that any semblance, any appearance of concession to the\nview that such things might exist is equivalent to a renunciation of all that I\nhold most sacred. But I’m afraid I have not succeeded in securing your\nattention.”',
				'“Your undivided attention, was what Dr Blimber actually\nsaid,”[4]\nRogers interrupted, with every appearance of an earnest desire for accuracy.\n“But I beg your pardon, Parkins: I’m stopping you.”',
				'[4]\nMr Rogers was wrong, vide Dombey and Son, chapter xii.',
				'“No, not at all,” said Parkins. “I don’t remember\nBlimber; perhaps he was before my time. But I needn’t go on. I’m\nsure you know what I mean.”',
				'“Yes, yes,” said Rogers, rather hastily—“just so.\nWe’ll go into it fully at Burnstow, or somewhere.”',
				'In repeating the above dialogue I have tried to give the impression which it\nmade on me, that Parkins was something of an old woman—rather henlike,\nperhaps, in his little ways; totally destitute, alas! of the sense of humour,\nbut at the same time dauntless and sincere in his convictions, and a man\ndeserving of the greatest respect. Whether or not the reader has gathered so\nmuch, that was the character which Parkins had.',
				'On the following day Parkins did, as he had hoped, succeed in getting away from\nhis college, and in arriving at Burnstow. He was made welcome at the Globe Inn,\nwas safely installed in the large double-bedded room of which we have heard,\nand was able before retiring to rest to arrange his materials for work in\napple-pie order upon a commodious table which occupied the outer end of the\nroom, and was surrounded on three sides by windows looking out seaward; that is\nto say, the central window looked straight out to sea, and those on the left\nand right commanded prospects along the shore to the north and south\nrespectively. On the south you saw the village of Burnstow. On the north no\nhouses were to be seen, but only the beach and the low cliff backing it.\nImmediately in front was a strip—not considerable—of rough grass,\ndotted with old anchors, capstans, and so forth; then a broad path; then the\nbeach. Whatever may have been the original distance between the Globe Inn and\nthe sea, not more than sixty yards now separated them.',
				'The rest of the population of the inn was, of course, a golfing one, and\nincluded few elements that call for a special description. The most conspicuous\nfigure was, perhaps, that of an ancien militaire, secretary of a London\nclub, and possessed of a voice of incredible strength, and of views of a\npronouncedly Protestant type. These were apt to find utterance after his\nattendance upon the ministrations of the Vicar, an estimable man with\ninclinations towards a picturesque ritual, which he gallantly kept down as far\nas he could out of deference to East Anglian tradition.',
				'Professor Parkins, one of whose principal characteristics was pluck, spent the\ngreater part of the day following his arrival at Burnstow in what he had called\nimproving his game, in company with this Colonel Wilson: and during the\nafternoon—whether the process of improvement were to blame or not, I am\nnot sure—the Colonel’s demeanour assumed a colouring so lurid that\neven Parkins jibbed at the thought of walking home with him from the links. He\ndetermined, after a short and furtive look at that bristling moustache and\nthose incarnadined features, that it would be wiser to allow the influences of\ntea and tobacco to do what they could with the Colonel before the dinner-hour\nshould render a meeting inevitable.',
				'“I might walk home tonight along the beach,” he\nreflected—“yes, and take a look—there will be light enough\nfor that—at the ruins of which Disney was talking. I don’t exactly\nknow where they are, by the way; but I expect I can hardly help stumbling on\nthem.”',
				'This he accomplished, I may say, in the most literal sense, for in picking his\nway from the links to the shingle beach his foot caught, partly in a gorse-root\nand partly in a biggish stone, and over he went. When he got up and surveyed\nhis surroundings, he found himself in a patch of somewhat broken ground covered\nwith small depressions and mounds. These latter, when he came to examine them,\nproved to be simply masses of flints embedded in mortar and grown over with\nturf. He must, he quite rightly concluded, be on the site of the preceptory he\nhad promised to look at. It seemed not unlikely to reward the spade of the\nexplorer; enough of the foundations was probably left at no great depth to\nthrow a good deal of light on the general plan. He remembered vaguely that the\nTemplars, to whom this site had belonged, were in the habit of building round\nchurches, and he thought a particular series of the humps or mounds near him\ndid appear to be arranged in something of a circular form. Few people can\nresist the temptation to try a little amateur research in a department quite\noutside their own, if only for the satisfaction of showing how successful they\nwould have been had they only taken it up seriously. Our Professor, however, if\nhe felt something of this mean desire, was also truly anxious to oblige Mr\nDisney. So he paced with care the circular area he had noticed, and wrote down\nits rough dimensions in his pocket-book. Then he proceeded to examine an oblong\neminence which lay east of the centre of the circle, and seemed to his thinking\nlikely to be the base of a platform or altar. At one end of it, the northern, a\npatch of the turf was gone—removed by some boy or other creature feraæ\nnaturæ. It might, he thought, be as well to probe the soil here for\nevidences of masonry, and he took out his knife and began scraping away the\nearth. And now followed another little discovery: a portion of soil fell inward\nas he scraped, and disclosed a small cavity. He lighted one match after another\nto help him to see of what nature the hole was, but the wind was too strong for\nthem all. By tapping and scratching the sides with his knife, however, he was\nable to make out that it must be an artificial hole in masonry. It was\nrectangular, and the sides, top, and bottom, if not actually plastered, were\nsmooth and regular. Of course it was empty. No! As he withdrew the knife he\nheard a metallic clink, and when he introduced his hand it met with a\ncylindrical object lying on the floor of the hole. Naturally enough, he picked\nit up, and when he brought it into the light, now fast fading, he could see\nthat it, too, was of man’s making—a metal tube about four inches\nlong, and evidently of some considerable age.',
				'By the time Parkins had made sure that there was nothing else in this odd\nreceptacle, it was too late and too dark for him to think of undertaking any\nfurther search. What he had done had proved so unexpectedly interesting that he\ndetermined to sacrifice a little more of the daylight on the morrow to\narchaeology. The object which he now had safe in his pocket was bound to be of\nsome slight value at least, he felt sure.',
				'Bleak and solemn was the view on which he took a last look before starting\nhomeward. A faint yellow light in the west showed the links, on which a few\nfigures moving towards the club-house were still visible, the squat martello\ntower, the lights of Aldsey village, the pale ribbon of sands intersected at\nintervals by black wooden groynings, the dim and murmuring sea. The wind was\nbitter from the north, but was at his back when he set out for the Globe. He\nquickly rattled and clashed through the shingle and gained the sand, upon\nwhich, but for the groynings which had to be got over every few yards, the\ngoing was both good and quiet. One last look behind, to measure the distance he\nhad made since leaving the ruined Templars’ church, showed him a prospect\nof company on his walk, in the shape of a rather indistinct personage, who\nseemed to be making great efforts to catch up with him, but made little, if\nany, progress. I mean that there was an appearance of running about his\nmovements, but that the distance between him and Parkins did not seem\nmaterially to lessen. So, at least, Parkins thought, and decided that he almost\ncertainly did not know him, and that it would be absurd to wait until he came\nup. For all that, company, he began to think, would really be very welcome on\nthat lonely shore, if only you could choose your companion. In his\nunenlightened days he had read of meetings in such places which even now would\nhardly bear thinking of. He went on thinking of them, however, until he reached\nhome, and particularly of one which catches most people’s fancy at some\ntime of their childhood. “Now I saw in my dream that Christian had gone\nbut a very little way when he saw a foul fiend coming over the field to meet\nhim.” “What should I do now,” he thought, “if I looked\nback and caught sight of a black figure sharply defined against the yellow sky,\nand saw that it had horns and wings? I wonder whether I should stand or run for\nit. Luckily, the gentleman behind is not of that kind, and he seems to be about\nas far off now as when I saw him first. Well, at this rate, he won’t get\nhis dinner as soon as I shall; and, dear me! it’s within a quarter of an\nhour of the time now. I must run!”',
				'Parkins had, in fact, very little time for dressing. When he met the Colonel at\ndinner, Peace—or as much of her as that gentleman could\nmanage—reigned once more in the military bosom; nor was she put to flight\nin the hours of bridge that followed dinner, for Parkins was a more than\nrespectable player. When, therefore, he retired towards twelve o’clock,\nhe felt that he had spent his evening in quite a satisfactory way, and that,\neven for so long as a fortnight or three weeks, life at the Globe would be\nsupportable under similar conditions—“especially,” thought\nhe, “if I go on improving my game.”',
				'As he went along the passages he met the boots of the Globe, who stopped and\nsaid:',
				'“Beg your pardon, sir, but as I was a-brushing your coat just now there\nwas somethink fell out of the pocket. I put it on your chest of drawers, sir,\nin your room, sir—a piece of a pipe or somethink of that, sir. Thank you,\nsir. You’ll find it on your chest of drawers, sir—yes, sir. Good\nnight, sir.”',
				'The speech served to remind Parkins of his little discovery of that afternoon.\nIt was with some considerable curiosity that he turned it over by the light of\nhis candles. It was of bronze, he now saw, and was shaped very much after the\nmanner of the modern dog-whistle; in fact it was—yes, certainly it\nwas—actually no more nor less than a whistle. He put it to his lips, but\nit was quite full of a fine, caked-up sand or earth, which would not yield to\nknocking, but must be loosened with a knife. Tidy as ever in his habits,\nParkins cleared out the earth on to a piece of paper, and took the latter to\nthe window to empty it out. The night was clear and bright, as he saw when he\nhad opened the casement, and he stopped for an instant to look at the sea and\nnote a belated wanderer stationed on the shore in front of the inn. Then he\nshut the window, a little surprised at the late hours people kept at Burnstow,\nand took his whistle to the light again. Why, surely there were marks on it,\nand not merely marks, but letters! A very little rubbing rendered the\ndeeply-cut inscription quite legible, but the Professor had to confess, after\nsome earnest thought, that the meaning of it was as obscure to him as the\nwriting on the wall to Belshazzar. There were legends both on the front and on\nthe back of the whistle. The one read thus:',
				'The other:',
				'“I ought to be able to make it out,” he thought; “but I\nsuppose I am a little rusty in my Latin. When I come to think of it, I\ndon’t believe I even know the word for a whistle. The long one does seem\nsimple enough. It ought to mean, ‘Who is this who is coming?’ Well,\nthe best way to find out is evidently to whistle for him.”',
				'He blew tentatively and stopped suddenly, startled and yet pleased at the note\nhe had elicited. It had a quality of infinite distance in it, and, soft as it\nwas, he somehow felt it must be audible for miles round. It was a sound, too,\nthat seemed to have the power (which many scents possess) of forming pictures\nin the brain. He saw quite clearly for a moment a vision of a wide, dark\nexpanse at night, with a fresh wind blowing, and in the midst a lonely\nfigure—how employed, he could not tell. Perhaps he would have seen more\nhad not the picture been broken by the sudden surge of a gust of wind against\nhis casement, so sudden that it made him look up, just in time to see the white\nglint of a seabird’s wing somewhere outside the dark panes.',
				'The sound of the whistle had so fascinated him that he could not help trying it\nonce more, this time more boldly. The note was little, if at all, louder than\nbefore, and repetition broke the illusion—no picture followed, as he had\nhalf hoped it might. ‘But what is this? Goodness! what force the wind can\nget up in a few minutes! What a tremendous gust! There! I knew that\nwindow-fastening was no use! Ah! I thought so—both candles out. It is\nenough to tear the room to pieces.’',
				'The first thing was to get the window shut. While you might count twenty\nParkins was struggling with the small casement, and felt almost as if he were\npushing back a sturdy burglar, so strong was the pressure. It slackened all at\nonce, and the window banged to and latched itself. Now to relight the candles\nand see what damage, if any, had been done. No, nothing seemed amiss; no glass\neven was broken in the casement. But the noise had evidently roused at least\none member of the household: the Colonel was to be heard stumping in his\nstockinged feet on the floor above, and growling.',
				'Quickly as it had risen, the wind did not fall at once. On it went, moaning and\nrushing past the house, at times rising to a cry so desolate that, as Parkins\ndisinterestedly said, it might have made fanciful people feel quite\nuncomfortable; even the unimaginative, he thought after a quarter of an hour,\nmight be happier without it.',
				'Whether it was the wind, or the excitement of golf, or of the researches in the\npreceptory that kept Parkins awake, he was not sure. Awake he remained, in any\ncase, long enough to fancy (as I am afraid I often do myself under such\nconditions) that he was the victim of all manner of fatal disorders: he would\nlie counting the beats of his heart, convinced that it was going to stop work\nevery moment, and would entertain grave suspicions of his lungs, brain, liver,\netc.—suspicions which he was sure would be dispelled by the return of\ndaylight, but which until then refused to be put aside. He found a little\nvicarious comfort in the idea that someone else was in the same boat. A near\nneighbour (in the darkness it was not easy to tell his direction) was tossing\nand rustling in his bed, too.',
				'The next stage was that Parkins shut his eyes and determined to give sleep\nevery chance. Here again over-excitement asserted itself in another\nform—that of making pictures. Experto crede, pictures do come to\nthe closed eyes of one trying to sleep, and are often so little to his taste\nthat he must open his eyes and disperse them.',
				'Parkins’s experience on this occasion was a very distressing one. He\nfound that the picture which presented itself to him was continuous. When he\nopened his eyes, of course, it went; but when he shut them once more it framed\nitself afresh, and acted itself out again, neither quicker nor slower than\nbefore. What he saw was this:',
				'A long stretch of shore—shingle edged by sand, and intersected at short\nintervals with black groynes running down to the water—a scene, in fact,\nso like that of his afternoon’s walk that, in the absence of any\nlandmark, it could not be distinguished therefrom. The light was obscure,\nconveying an impression of gathering storm, late winter evening, and slight\ncold rain. On this bleak stage at first no actor was visible. Then, in the\ndistance, a bobbing black object appeared; a moment more, and it was a man\nrunning, jumping, clambering over the groynes, and every few seconds looking\neagerly back. The nearer he came the more obvious it was that he was not only\nanxious, but even terribly frightened, though his face was not to be\ndistinguished. He was, moreover, almost at the end of his strength. On he came;\neach successive obstacle seemed to cause him more difficulty than the last.\n“Will he get over this next one?” thought Parkins; “it seems\na little higher than the others.” Yes; half climbing, half throwing\nhimself, he did get over, and fell all in a heap on the other side (the side\nnearest to the spectator). There, as if really unable to get up again, he\nremained crouching under the groyne, looking up in an attitude of painful\nanxiety.',
				'So far no cause whatever for the fear of the runner had been shown; but now\nthere began to be seen, far up the shore, a little flicker of something\nlight-coloured moving to and fro with great swiftness and irregularity. Rapidly\ngrowing larger, it, too, declared itself as a figure in pale, fluttering\ndraperies, ill-defined. There was something about its motion which made Parkins\nvery unwilling to see it at close quarters. It would stop, raise arms, bow\nitself towards the sand, then run stooping across the beach to the water-edge\nand back again; and then, rising upright, once more continue its course forward\nat a speed that was startling and terrifying. The moment came when the pursuer\nwas hovering about from left to right only a few yards beyond the groyne where\nthe runner lay in hiding. After two or three ineffectual castings hither and\nthither it came to a stop, stood upright, with arms raised high, and then\ndarted straight forward towards the groyne.',
				'It was at this point that Parkins always failed in his resolution to keep his\neyes shut. With many misgivings as to incipient failure of eyesight, overworked\nbrain, excessive smoking, and so on, he finally resigned himself to light his\ncandle, get out a book, and pass the night waking, rather than be tormented by\nthis persistent panorama, which he saw clearly enough could only be a morbid\nreflection of his walk and his thoughts on that very day.',
				'The scraping of match on box and the glare of light must have startled some\ncreatures of the night—rats or what not—which he heard scurry\nacross the floor from the side of his bed with much rustling. Dear, dear! the\nmatch is out! Fool that it is! But the second one burnt better, and a candle\nand book were duly procured, over which Parkins pored till sleep of a wholesome\nkind came upon him, and that in no long space. For about the first time in his\norderly and prudent life he forgot to blow out the candle, and when he was\ncalled next morning at eight there was still a flicker in the socket and a sad\nmess of guttered grease on the top of the little table.',
				'After breakfast he was in his room, putting the finishing touches to his\ngolfing costume—fortune had again allotted the Colonel to him for a\npartner—when one of the maids came in.',
				'“Oh, if you please,” she said, “would you like any extra\nblankets on your bed, sir?”',
				'“Ah! thank you,” said Parkins. “Yes, I think I should like\none. It seems likely to turn rather colder.”',
				'In a very short time the maid was back with the blanket.',
				'“Which bed should I put it on, sir?” she asked.',
				'“What? Why, that one—the one I slept in last night,” he said,\npointing to it.',
				'“Oh yes! I beg your pardon, sir, but you seemed to have tried both of\n“em; leastways, we had to make ’em both up this morning.”',
				'“Really? How very absurd!” said Parkins. “I certainly never\ntouched the other, except to lay some things on it. Did it actually seem to\nhave been slept in?”',
				'“Oh yes, sir!” said the maid. “Why, all the things was\ncrumpled and throwed about all ways, if you’ll excuse me, sir—quite\nas if anyone ’adn’t passed but a very poor night, sir.”',
				'“Dear me,” said Parkins. “Well, I may have disordered it more\nthan I thought when I unpacked my things. I’m very sorry to have given\nyou the extra trouble, I’m sure. I expect a friend of mine soon, by the\nway—a gentleman from Cambridge—to come and occupy it for a night or\ntwo. That will be all right, I suppose, won’t it?”',
				'“Oh yes, to be sure, sir. Thank you, sir. It’s no trouble,\nI’m sure,” said the maid, and departed to giggle with her\ncolleagues.',
				'Parkins set forth, with a stern determination to improve his game.',
				'I am glad to be able to report that he succeeded so far in this enterprise that\nthe Colonel, who had been rather repining at the prospect of a second\nday’s play in his company, became quite chatty as the morning advanced;\nand his voice boomed out over the flats, as certain also of our own minor poets\nhave said, “like some great bourdon in a minster tower”.',
				'“Extraordinary wind, that, we had last night,” he said. “In\nmy old home we should have said someone had been whistling for it.”',
				'“Should you, indeed!” said Parkins. “Is there a superstition\nof that kind still current in your part of the country?”',
				'“I don’t know about superstition,” said the Colonel.\n“They believe in it all over Denmark and Norway, as well as on the\nYorkshire coast; and my experience is, mind you, that there’s generally\nsomething at the bottom of what these country-folk hold to, and have held to\nfor generations. But it’s your drive” (or whatever it might have\nbeen: the golfing reader will have to imagine appropriate digressions at the\nproper intervals).',
				'When conversation was resumed, Parkins said, with a slight hesitancy:',
				'“A propos of what you were saying just now, Colonel, I think I ought to\ntell you that my own views on such subjects are very strong. I am, in fact, a\nconvinced disbeliever in what is called the ‘supernatural’.”',
				'“What!” said the Colonel, “do you mean to tell me you\ndon’t believe in second-sight, or ghosts, or anything of that\nkind?”',
				'“In nothing whatever of that kind,” returned Parkins firmly.',
				'“Well,” said the Colonel, “but it appears to me at that rate,\nsir, that you must be little better than a Sadducee.”',
				'Parkins was on the point of answering that, in his opinion, the Sadducees were\nthe most sensible persons he had ever read of in the Old Testament; but,\nfeeling some doubt as to whether much mention of them was to be found in that\nwork, he preferred to laugh the accusation off.',
				'“Perhaps I am,” he said; “but—Here, give me my cleek,\nboy!—Excuse me one moment, Colonel.” A short interval. “Now,\nas to whistling for the wind, let me give you my theory about it. The laws\nwhich govern winds are really not at all perfectly known—to fisherfolk\nand such, of course, not known at all. A man or woman of eccentric habits,\nperhaps, or a stranger, is seen repeatedly on the beach at some unusual hour,\nand is heard whistling. Soon afterwards a violent wind rises; a man who could\nread the sky perfectly or who possessed a barometer could have foretold that it\nwould. The simple people of a fishing-village have no barometers, and only a\nfew rough rules for prophesying weather. What more natural than that the\neccentric personage I postulated should be regarded as having raised the wind,\nor that he or she should clutch eagerly at the reputation of being able to do\nso? Now, take last night’s wind: as it happens, I myself was whistling. I\nblew a whistle twice, and the wind seemed to come absolutely in answer to my\ncall. If anyone had seen me—”',
				'The audience had been a little restive under this harangue, and Parkins had, I\nfear, fallen somewhat into the tone of a lecturer; but at the last sentence the\nColonel stopped.',
				'“Whistling, were you?” he said. “And what sort of whistle did\nyou use? Play this stroke first.” Interval.',
				'“About that whistle you were asking, Colonel. It’s rather a curious\none. I have it in my—No; I see I’ve left it in my room. As a matter\nof fact, I found it yesterday.”',
				'And then Parkins narrated the manner of his discovery of the whistle, upon\nhearing which the Colonel grunted, and opined that, in Parkins’s place,\nhe should himself be careful about using a thing that had belonged to a set of\nPapists, of whom, speaking generally, it might be affirmed that you never knew\nwhat they might not have been up to. From this topic he diverged to the\nenormities of the Vicar, who had given notice on the previous Sunday that\nFriday would be the Feast of St Thomas the Apostle, and that there would be\nservice at eleven o’clock in the church. This and other similar\nproceedings constituted in the Colonel’s view a strong presumption that\nthe Vicar was a concealed Papist, if not a Jesuit; and Parkins, who could not\nvery readily follow the Colonel in this region, did not disagree with him. In\nfact, they got on so well together in the morning that there was no talk on\neither side of their separating after lunch.',
				'Both continued to play well during the afternoon, or, at least, well enough to\nmake them forget everything else until the light began to fail them. Not until\nthen did Parkins remember that he had meant to do some more investigating at\nthe preceptory; but it was of no great importance, he reflected. One day was as\ngood as another; he might as well go home with the Colonel.',
				'As they turned the corner of the house, the Colonel was almost knocked down by\na boy who rushed into him at the very top of his speed, and then, instead of\nrunning away, remained hanging on to him and panting. The first words of the\nwarrior were naturally those of reproof and objurgation, but he very quickly\ndiscerned that the boy was almost speechless with fright. Inquiries were\nuseless at first. When the boy got his breath he began to howl, and still clung\nto the Colonel’s legs. He was at last detached, but continued to howl.',
				'“What in the world is the matter with you? What have you been up\nto? What have you seen?” said the two men.',
				'“Ow, I seen it wive at me out of the winder,” wailed the boy,\n“and I don’t like it.”',
				'“What window?” said the irritated Colonel. “Come, pull\nyourself together, my boy.”',
				'“The front winder it was, at the ’otel,” said the boy.',
				'At this point Parkins was in favour of sending the boy home, but the Colonel\nrefused; he wanted to get to the bottom of it, he said; it was most dangerous\nto give a boy such a fright as this one had had, and if it turned out that\npeople had been playing jokes, they should suffer for it in some way. And by a\nseries of questions he made out this story: The boy had been playing about on\nthe grass in front of the Globe with some others; then they had gone home to\ntheir teas, and he was just going, when he happened to look up at the front\nwinder and see it a-wiving at him. It seemed to be a figure of some\nsort, in white as far as he knew—couldn’t see its face; but it\nwived at him, and it warn’t a right thing—not to say not a right\nperson. Was there a light in the room? No, he didn’t think to look if\nthere was a light. Which was the window? Was it the top one or the second one?\nThe seckind one it was—the big winder what got two little uns at the\nsides.',
				'“Very well, my boy,” said the Colonel, after a few more questions.\n“You run away home now. I expect it was some person trying to give you a\nstart. Another time, like a brave English boy, you just throw a\nstone—well, no, not that exactly, but you go and speak to the waiter, or\nto Mr Simpson, the landlord, and—yes—and say that I advised you to\ndo so.”',
				'The boy’s face expressed some of the doubt he felt as to the likelihood\nof Mr Simpson’s lending a favourable ear to his complaint, but the\nColonel did not appear to perceive this, and went on:',
				'“And here’s a sixpence—no, I see it’s a\nshilling—and you be off home, and don’t think any more about\nit.”',
				'The youth hurried off with agitated thanks, and the Colonel and Parkins went\nround to the front of the Globe and reconnoitred. There was only one window\nanswering to the description they had been hearing.',
				'“Well, that’s curious,” said Parkins; “it’s\nevidently my window the lad was talking about. Will you come up for a moment,\nColonel Wilson? We ought to be able to see if anyone has been taking liberties\nin my room.”',
				'They were soon in the passage, and Parkins made as if to open the door. Then he\nstopped and felt in his pockets.',
				'“This is more serious than I thought,” was his next remark.\n“I remember now that before I started this morning I locked the door. It\nis locked now, and, what is more, here is the key.” And he held it up.\n“Now,” he went on, “if the servants are in the habit of going\ninto one’s room during the day when one is away, I can only say\nthat—well, that I don’t approve of it at all.” Conscious of a\nsomewhat weak climax, he busied himself in opening the door (which was indeed\nlocked) and in lighting candles. “No,” he said, “nothing\nseems disturbed.”',
				'“Except your bed,” put in the Colonel.',
				'“Excuse me, that isn’t my bed,” said Parkins. “I\ndon’t use that one. But it does look as if someone had been playing\ntricks with it.”',
				'It certainly did: the clothes were bundled up and twisted together in a most\ntortuous confusion. Parkins pondered.',
				'“That must be it,” he said at last: “I disordered the clothes\nlast night in unpacking, and they haven’t made it since. Perhaps they\ncame in to make it, and that boy saw them through the window; and then they\nwere called away and locked the door after them. Yes, I think that must be\nit.”',
				'“Well, ring and ask,” said the Colonel, and this appealed to\nParkins as practical.',
				'The maid appeared, and, to make a long story short, deposed that she had made\nthe bed in the morning when the gentleman was in the room, and hadn’t\nbeen there since. No, she hadn’t no other key. Mr Simpson he kep’\nthe keys; he’d be able to tell the gentleman if anyone had been up.',
				'This was a puzzle. Investigation showed that nothing of value had been taken,\nand Parkins remembered the disposition of the small objects on tables and so\nforth well enough to be pretty sure that no pranks had been played with them.\nMr and Mrs Simpson furthermore agreed that neither of them had given the\nduplicate key of the room to any person whatever during the day. Nor could\nParkins, fair-minded man as he was, detect anything in the demeanour of master,\nmistress, or maid that indicated guilt. He was much more inclined to think that\nthe boy had been imposing on the Colonel.',
				'The latter was unwontedly silent and pensive at dinner and throughout the\nevening. When he bade goodnight to Parkins, he murmured in a gruff undertone:',
				'“You know where I am if you want me during the night.”',
				'“Why, yes, thank you, Colonel Wilson, I think I do; but there isn’t\nmuch prospect of my disturbing you, I hope. By the way,” he added,\n“did I show you that old whistle I spoke of? I think not. Well, here it\nis.”',
				'The Colonel turned it over gingerly in the light of the candle.',
				'“Can you make anything of the inscription?” asked Parkins, as he\ntook it back.',
				'“No, not in this light. What do you mean to do with it?”',
				'“Oh, well, when I get back to Cambridge I shall submit it to some of the\narchaeologists there, and see what they think of it; and very likely, if they\nconsider it worth having, I may present it to one of the museums.”',
				'“’M!” said the Colonel. “Well, you may be right. All I\nknow is that, if it were mine, I should chuck it straight into the sea.\nIt’s no use talking, I’m well aware, but I expect that with you\nit’s a case of live and learn. I hope so, I’m sure, and I wish you\na good night.”',
				'He turned away, leaving Parkins in act to speak at the bottom of the stair, and\nsoon each was in his own bedroom.',
				'By some unfortunate accident, there were neither blinds nor curtains to the\nwindows of the Professor’s room. The previous night he had thought little\nof this, but tonight there seemed every prospect of a bright moon rising to\nshine directly on his bed, and probably wake him later on. When he noticed this\nhe was a good deal annoyed, but, with an ingenuity which I can only envy, he\nsucceeded in rigging up, with the help of a railway-rug, some safety-pins, and\na stick and umbrella, a screen which, if it only held together, would\ncompletely keep the moonlight off his bed. And shortly afterwards he was\ncomfortably in that bed. When he had read a somewhat solid work long enough to\nproduce a decided wish for sleep, he cast a drowsy glance round the room, blew\nout the candle, and fell back upon the pillow.',
				'He must have slept soundly for an hour or more, when a sudden clatter shook him\nup in a most unwelcome manner. In a moment he realized what had happened: his\ncarefully-constructed screen had given way, and a very bright frosty moon was\nshining directly on his face. This was highly annoying. Could he possibly get\nup and reconstruct the screen? or could he manage to sleep if he did not?',
				'For some minutes he lay and pondered over the possibilities; then he turned\nover sharply, and with his eyes open lay breathlessly listening. There had been\na movement, he was sure, in the empty bed on the opposite side of the room.\nTomorrow he would have it moved, for there must be rats or something playing\nabout in it. It was quiet now. No! the commotion began again. There was a\nrustling and shaking: surely more than any rat could cause.',
				'I can figure to myself something of the Professor’s bewilderment and\nhorror, for I have in a dream thirty years back seen the same thing happen; but\nthe reader will hardly, perhaps, imagine how dreadful it was to him to see a\nfigure suddenly sit up in what he had known was an empty bed. He was out of his\nown bed in one bound, and made a dash towards the window, where lay his only\nweapon, the stick with which he had propped his screen. This was, as it turned\nout, the worst thing he could have done, because the personage in the empty\nbed, with a sudden smooth motion, slipped from the bed and took up a position,\nwith outspread arms, between the two beds, and in front of the door. Parkins\nwatched it in a horrid perplexity. Somehow, the idea of getting past it and\nescaping through the door was intolerable to him; he could not have\nborne—he didn’t know why—to touch it; and as for its touching\nhim, he would sooner dash himself through the window than have that happen. It\nstood for the moment in a band of dark shadow, and he had not seen what its\nface was like. Now it began to move, in a stooping posture, and all at once the\nspectator realized, with some horror and some relief, that it must be blind,\nfor it seemed to feel about it with its muffled arms in a groping and random\nfashion. Turning half away from him, it became suddenly conscious of the bed he\nhad just left, and darted towards it, and bent and felt over the pillows in a\nway which made Parkins shudder as he had never in his life thought it possible.\nIn a very few moments it seemed to know that the bed was empty, and then,\nmoving forward into the area of light and facing the window, it showed for the\nfirst time what manner of thing it was.',
				'Parkins, who very much dislikes being questioned about it, did once describe\nsomething of it in my hearing, and I gathered that what he chiefly remembers\nabout it is a horrible, an intensely horrible, face of crumpled linen.\nWhat expression he read upon it he could not or would not tell, but that the\nfear of it went nigh to maddening him is certain.',
				'But he was not at leisure to watch it for long. With formidable quickness it\nmoved into the middle of the room, and, as it groped and waved, one corner of\nits draperies swept across Parkins’s face. He could not, though he knew\nhow perilous a sound was—he could not keep back a cry of disgust, and\nthis gave the searcher an instant clue. It leapt towards him upon the instant,\nand the next moment he was half-way through the window backwards, uttering cry\nupon cry at the utmost pitch of his voice, and the linen face was thrust close\ninto his own. At this, almost the last possible second, deliverance came, as\nyou will have guessed: the Colonel burst the door open, and was just in time to\nsee the dreadful group at the window. When he reached the figures only one was\nleft. Parkins sank forward into the room in a faint, and before him on the\nfloor lay a tumbled heap of bed-clothes.',
				'Colonel Wilson asked no questions, but busied himself in keeping everyone else\nout of the room and in getting Parkins back to his bed; and himself, wrapped in\na rug, occupied the other bed, for the rest of the night. Early on the next day\nRogers arrived, more welcome than he would have been a day before, and the\nthree of them held a very long consultation in the Professor’s room. At\nthe end of it the Colonel left the hotel door carrying a small object between\nhis finger and thumb, which he cast as far into the sea as a very brawny arm\ncould send it. Later on the smoke of a burning ascended from the back premises\nof the Globe.',
				'Exactly what explanation was patched up for the staff and visitors at the hotel\nI must confess I do not recollect. The Professor was somehow cleared of the\nready suspicion of delirium tremens, and the hotel of the reputation of a\ntroubled house.',
				'There is not much question as to what would have happened to Parkins if the\nColonel had not intervened when he did. He would either have fallen out of the\nwindow or else lost his wits. But it is not so evident what more the creature\nthat came in answer to the whistle could have done than frighten. There seemed\nto be absolutely nothing material about it save the bedclothes of which it had\nmade itself a body. The Colonel, who remembered a not very dissimilar\noccurrence in India, was of the opinion that if Parkins had closed with it it\ncould really have done very little, and that its one power was that of\nfrightening. The whole thing, he said, served to confirm his opinion of the\nChurch of Rome.',
				'There is really nothing more to tell, but, as you may imagine, the\nProfessor’s views on certain points are less clear cut than they used to\nbe. His nerves, too, have suffered: he cannot even now see a surplice hanging\non a door quite unmoved, and the spectacle of a scarecrow in a field late on a\nwinter afternoon has cost him more than one sleepless night.',

				'Verum usque in præsentem diem multa garriunt inter se Canonici de abscondito\nquodam istius Abbatis Thomæ thesauro, quem sæpe, quanquam adhuc incassum,\nquæsiverunt Steinfeldenses. Ipsum enim Thomam adhuc florida in ætate existentem\ningentem auri massam circa monasterium defodisse perhibent; de quo multoties\ninterrogatus ubi esset, cum risu respondere solitus erat: “Job, Johannes,\net Zacharias vel vobis vel posteris indicabunt”; idemque aliquando\nadiicere se inventuris minime invisurum. Inter alia huius Abbatis opera, hoc\nmemoria præcipue dignum iudico quod fenestram magnam in orientali parte alæ\naustralis in ecclesia sua imaginibus optime in vitro depictis impleverit: id\nquod et ipsius effigies et insignia ibidem posita demonstrant. Domum quoque\nAbbatialem fere totam restauravit: puteo in atrio ipsius effosso et lapidibus\nmarmoreis pulchre cælatis exornato. Decessit autem, morte aliquantulum\nsubitanea perculsus, ætatis suæ anno lxxiido, incarnationis vero\nDominiæ mdxxixo.',
				'“I suppose I shall have to translate this,” said the antiquary to\nhimself, as he finished copying the above lines from that rather rare and\nexceedingly diffuse book, the Sertum Steinfeldense Norbertinum.[5]\n“Well, it may as well be done first as last,” and accordingly the\nfollowing rendering was very quickly produced:',
				'[5]\nAn account of the Premonstratensian abbey of Steinfeld, in the Eiffel, with\nlives of the Abbots, published at Cologne in 1712 by Christian Albert Erhard, a\nresident in the district. The epithet Norbertinum is due to the fact\nthat St Norbert was founder of the Premonstratensian Order.',
				'Up to the present day there is much gossip among the Canons about a certain\nhidden treasure of this Abbot Thomas, for which those of Steinfeld have often\nmade search, though hitherto in vain. The story is that Thomas, while yet in\nthe vigour of life, concealed a very large quantity of gold somewhere in the\nmonastery. He was often asked where it was, and always answered, with a laugh:\n“Job, John, and Zechariah will tell either you or your successors.”\nHe sometimes added that he should feel no grudge against those who might find\nit. Among other works carried out by this Abbot I may specially mention his\nfilling the great window at the east end of the south aisle of the church with\nfigures admirably painted on glass, as his effigy and arms in the window\nattest. He also restored almost the whole of the Abbot’s lodging, and dug\na well in the court of it, which he adorned with beautiful carvings in marble.\nHe died rather suddenly in the seventy-second year of his age, A.D. 1529.',
				'The object which the antiquary had before him at the moment was that of tracing\nthe whereabouts of the painted windows of the Abbey Church of Steinfeld.\nShortly after the Revolution, a very large quantity of painted glass made its\nway from the dissolved abbeys of Germany and Belgium to this country, and may\nnow be seen adorning various of our parish churches, cathedrals, and private\nchapels. Steinfeld Abbey was among the most considerable of these involuntary\ncontributors to our artistic possessions (I am quoting the somewhat ponderous\npreamble of the book which the antiquary wrote), and the greater part of the\nglass from that institution can be identified without much difficulty by the\nhelp, either of the numerous inscriptions in which the place is mentioned, or\nof the subjects of the windows, in which several well-defined cycles or\nnarratives were represented.',
				'The passage with which I began my story had set the antiquary on the track of\nanother identification. In a private chapel—no matter where—he had\nseen three large figures, each occupying a whole light in a window, and\nevidently the work of one artist. Their style made it plain that that artist\nhad been a German of the sixteenth century; but hitherto the more exact\nlocalizing of them had been a puzzle. They represented—will you be\nsurprised to hear it?—JOB PATRIARCHA,\nJOHANNES EVANGELISTA, ZACHARIAS\nPROPHETA, and each of them held a book or scroll, inscribed with\na sentence from his writings. These, as a matter of course, the antiquary had\nnoted, and had been struck by the curious way in which they differed from any\ntext of the Vulgate that he had been able to examine. Thus the scroll in\nJob’s hand was inscribed: Auro est locus in quo absconditur (for\nconflatur);[6]\non the book of John was: Habent in vestimentis suis scripturam quam nemo\nnovit[7] (for in\nvestimento scriptum, the following words being taken from another\nverse); and Zacharias had: Super lapidem unum septem oculi sunt[8]\n(which alone of the three presents an unaltered text).',
				'[6]\nThere is a place for gold where it is hidden.',
				'[7]\nThey have on their raiment a writing which no man knoweth.',
				'[8]\nUpon one stone are seven eyes.',
				'A sad perplexity it had been to our investigator to think why these three\npersonages should have been placed together in one window. There was no bond of\nconnexion between them, either historic, symbolic, or doctrinal, and he could\nonly suppose that they must have formed part of a very large series of Prophets\nand Apostles, which might have filled, say, all the clerestory windows of some\ncapacious church. But the passage from the Sertum had altered the\nsituation by showing that the names of the actual personages represented in the\nglass now in Lord D——’s chapel had been constantly on the\nlips of Abbot Thomas von Eschenhausen of Steinfeld, and that this Abbot had put\nup a painted window, probably about the year 1520, in the south aisle of his\nabbey church. It was no very wild conjecture that the three figures might have\nformed part of Abbot Thomas’s offering; it was one which, moreover, could\nprobably be confirmed or set aside by another careful examination of the glass.\nAnd, as Mr. Somerton was a man of leisure, he set out on pilgrimage to the\nprivate chapel with very little delay. His conjecture was confirmed to the\nfull. Not only did the style and technique of the glass suit perfectly with the\ndate and place required, but in another window of the chapel he found some\nglass, known to have been bought along with the figures, which contained the\narms of Abbot Thomas von Eschenhausen.',
				'At intervals during his researches Mr. Somerton had been haunted by the\nrecollection of the gossip about the hidden treasure, and, as he thought the\nmatter over, it became more and more obvious to him that if the Abbot meant\nanything by the enigmatical answer which he gave to his questioners, he must\nhave meant that the secret was to be found somewhere in the window he had\nplaced in the abbey church. It was undeniable, furthermore, that the first of\nthe curiously-selected texts on the scrolls in the window might be taken to\nhave a reference to hidden treasure.',
				'Every feature, therefore, or mark which could possibly assist in elucidating\nthe riddle which, he felt sure, the Abbot had set to posterity he noted with\nscrupulous care, and, returning to his Berkshire manor-house, consumed many a\npint of the midnight oil over his tracings and sketches. After two or three\nweeks, a day came when Mr Somerton announced to his man that he must pack his\nown and his master’s things for a short journey abroad, whither for the\nmoment we will not follow him.',
				'Mr Gregory, the Rector of Parsbury, had strolled out before breakfast, it being\na fine autumn morning, as far as the gate of his carriage-drive, with intent to\nmeet the postman and sniff the cool air. Nor was he disappointed of either\npurpose. Before he had had time to answer more than ten or eleven of the\nmiscellaneous questions propounded to him in the lightness of their hearts by\nhis young offspring, who had accompanied him, the postman was seen approaching;\nand among the morning’s budget was one letter bearing a foreign postmark\nand stamp (which became at once the objects of an eager competition among the\nyouthful Gregorys), and was addressed in an uneducated, but plainly an English\nhand.',
				'When the Rector opened it, and turned to the signature, he realized that it\ncame from the confidential valet of his friend and squire, Mr. Somerton. Thus\nit ran:',
				'HONOURED SIR,\n    Has I am in a great anxiety about Master I write at is Wish to beg you Sir\nif you could be so good as Step over. Master Has add a Nastey Shock and keeps\nHis Bedd.

				'P.S.—The Village for Town I will not Turm. It is name Steenfeld.',
				'The reader must be left to picture to himself in detail the surprise,\nconfusion, and hurry of preparation into which the receipt of such a letter\nwould be likely to plunge a quiet Berkshire parsonage in the year of grace\n1859. It is enough for me to say that a train to town was caught in the course\nof the day, and that Mr Gregory was able to secure a cabin in the Antwerp boat\nand a place in the Coblentz train. Nor was it difficult to manage the transit\nfrom that centre to Steinfeld.',
				'I labour under a grave disadvantage as narrator of this story in that I have\nnever visited Steinfeld myself, and that neither of the principal actors in the\nepisode (from whom I derive my information) was able to give me anything but a\nvague and rather dismal idea of its appearance. I gather that it is a small\nplace, with a large church despoiled of its ancient fittings; a number of\nrather ruinous great buildings, mostly of the seventeenth century, surround\nthis church; for the abbey, in common with most of those on the Continent, was\nrebuilt in a luxurious fashion by its inhabitants at that period. It has not\nseemed to me worth while to lavish money on a visit to the place, for though it\nis probably far more attractive than either Mr Somerton or Mr Gregory thought\nit, there is evidently little, if anything, of first-rate interest to be\nseen—except, perhaps, one thing, which I should not care to see.',
				'The inn where the English gentleman and his servant were lodged is, or was, the\nonly “possible” one in the village. Mr Gregory was taken to it at\nonce by his driver, and found Mr Brown waiting at the door. Mr Brown, a model\nwhen in his Berkshire home of the impassive whiskered race who are known as\nconfidential valets, was now egregiously out of his element, in a light tweed\nsuit, anxious, almost irritable, and plainly anything but master of the\nsituation. His relief at the sight of the “honest British face” of\nhis Rector was unmeasured, but words to describe it were denied him. He could\nonly say:',
				'“Well, I ham pleased, I’m sure, sir, to see you. And so I’m\nsure, sir, will master.”',
				'“How is your master, Brown?” Mr Gregory eagerly put in.',
				'“I think he’s better, sir, thank you; but he’s had a dreadful\ntime of it. I ’ope he’s gettin’ some sleep now,\nbut—”',
				'“What has been the matter—I couldn’t make out from your\nletter? Was it an accident of any kind?”',
				'“Well, sir, I ’ardly know whether I’d better speak about it.\nMaster was very partickler he should be the one to tell you. But there’s\nno bones broke—that’s one thing I’m sure we ought to be\nthankful—”',
				'“What does the doctor say?” asked Mr Gregory.',
				'They were by this time outside Mr Somerton’s bedroom door, and speaking\nin low tones. Mr Gregory, who happened to be in front, was feeling for the\nhandle, and chanced to run his fingers over the panels. Before Brown could\nanswer, there was a terrible cry from within the room.',
				'“In God’s name, who is that?” were the first words they\nheard. “Brown, is it?”',
				'“Yes, sir—me, sir, and Mr Gregory,” Brown hastened to answer,\nand there was an audible groan of relief in reply.',
				'They entered the room, which was darkened against the afternoon sun, and Mr\nGregory saw, with a shock of pity, how drawn, how damp with drops of fear, was\nthe usually calm face of his friend, who, sitting up in the curtained bed,\nstretched out a shaking hand to welcome him.',
				'“Better for seeing you, my dear Gregory,” was the reply to the\nRector’s first question, and it was palpably true.',
				'After five minutes of conversation Mr Somerton was more his own man, Brown\nafterwards reported, than he had been for days. He was able to eat a more than\nrespectable dinner, and talked confidently of being fit to stand a journey to\nCoblentz within twenty-four hours.',
				'“But there’s one thing,” he said, with a return of agitation\nwhich Mr Gregory did not like to see, “which I must beg you to do for me,\nmy dear Gregory. Don’t,” he went on, laying his hand on\nGregory’s to forestall any interruption—“don’t ask me\nwhat it is, or why I want it done. I’m not up to explaining it yet; it\nwould throw me back—undo all the good you have done me by coming. The\nonly word I will say about it is that you run no risk whatever by doing it, and\nthat Brown can and will show you tomorrow what it is. It’s merely to put\nback—to keep—something—No; I can’t speak of it yet. Do\nyou mind calling Brown?”',
				'“Well, Somerton,” said Mr Gregory, as he crossed the room to the\ndoor, “I won’t ask for any explanations till you see fit to give\nthem. And if this bit of business is as easy as you represent it to be, I will\nvery gladly undertake it for you the first thing in the morning.”',
				'“Ah, I was sure you would, my dear Gregory; I was certain I could rely on\nyou. I shall owe you more thanks than I can tell. Now, here is Brown. Brown,\none word with you.”',
				'“Shall I go?” interjected Mr Gregory.',
				'“Not at all. Dear me, no. Brown, the first thing tomorrow\nmorning—(you don’t mind early hours, I know, Gregory)—you\nmust take the Rector to—there, you know” (a nod from Brown,\nwho looked grave and anxious), “and he and you will put that back. You\nneedn’t be in the least alarmed; it’s perfectly safe in the\ndaytime. You know what I mean. It lies on the step, you know, where—where\nwe put it.” (Brown swallowed dryly once or twice, and, failing to speak,\nbowed.) “And—yes, that’s all. Only this one other word, my\ndear Gregory. If you can manage to keep from questioning Brown about\nthis matter, I shall be still more bound to you. Tomorrow evening, at latest,\nif all goes well, I shall be able, I believe, to tell you the whole story from\nstart to finish. And now I’ll wish you good night. Brown will be with\nme—he sleeps here—and if I were you, I should lock my door. Yes, be\nparticular to do that. They—they like it, the people here, and it’s\nbetter. Good night, good night.”',
				'They parted upon this, and if Mr Gregory woke once or twice in the small hours\nand fancied he heard a fumbling about the lower part of his locked door, it\nwas, perhaps, no more than what a quiet man, suddenly plunged into a strange\nbed and the heart of a mystery, might reasonably expect. Certainly he thought,\nto the end of his days, that he had heard such a sound twice or three times\nbetween midnight and dawn.',
				'He was up with the sun, and out in company with Brown soon after. Perplexing as\nwas the service he had been asked to perform for Mr Somerton, it was not a\ndifficult or an alarming one, and within half an hour from his leaving the inn\nit was over. What it was I shall not as yet divulge.',
				'Later in the morning Mr Somerton, now almost himself again, was able to make a\nstart from Steinfeld; and that same evening, whether at Coblentz or at some\nintermediate stage on the journey I am not certain, he settled down to the\npromised explanation. Brown was present, but how much of the matter was ever\nreally made plain to his comprehension he would never say, and I am unable to\nconjecture.',
				'This was Mr Somerton’s story:',
				'“You know roughly, both of you, that this expedition of mine was\nundertaken with the object of tracing something in connexion with some old\npainted glass in Lord D——’s private chapel. Well, the\nstarting-point of the whole matter lies in this passage from an old printed\nbook, to which I will ask your attention.”',
				'And at this point Mr Somerton went carefully over some ground with which we are\nalready familiar.',
				'“On my second visit to the chapel,” he went on, “my purpose\nwas to take every note I could of figures, lettering, diamond-scratchings on\nthe glass, and even apparently accidental markings. The first point which I\ntackled was that of the inscribed scrolls. I could not doubt that the first of\nthese, that of Job—‘There is a place for the gold where it is\nhidden’—with its intentional alteration, must refer to the\ntreasure; so I applied myself with some confidence to the next, that of St\nJohn—‘They have on their vestures a writing which no man\nknoweth.’ The natural question will have occurred to you: Was there an\ninscription on the robes of the figures? I could see none; each of the three\nhad a broad black border to his mantle, which made a conspicuous and rather\nugly feature in the window. I was nonplussed, I will own, and, but for a\ncurious bit of luck, I think I should have left the search where the Canons of\nSteinfeld had left it before me. But it so happened that there was a good deal\nof dust on the surface of the glass, and Lord D——, happening to\ncome in, noticed my blackened hands, and kindly insisted on sending for a\nTurk’s head broom to clean down the window. There must, I suppose, have\nbeen a rough piece in the broom; anyhow, as it passed over the border of one of\nthe mantles, I noticed that it left a long scratch, and that some yellow stain\ninstantly showed up. I asked the man to stop his work for a moment, and ran up\nthe ladder to examine the place. The yellow stain was there, sure enough, and\nwhat had come away was a thick black pigment, which had evidently been laid on\nwith the brush after the glass had been burnt, and could therefore be easily\nscraped off without doing any harm. I scraped, accordingly, and you will hardly\nbelieve—no, I do you an injustice; you will have guessed\nalready—that I found under this black pigment two or three clearly-formed\ncapital letters in yellow stain on a clear ground. Of course, I could hardly\ncontain my delight.',
				'“I told Lord D—— that I had detected an inscription which I\nthought might be very interesting, and begged to be allowed to uncover the\nwhole of it. He made no difficulty about it whatever, told me to do exactly as\nI pleased, and then, having an engagement, was obliged—rather to my\nrelief, I must say—to leave me. I set to work at once, and found the task\na fairly easy one. The pigment, disintegrated, of course, by time, came off\nalmost at a touch, and I don’t think that it took me a couple of hours,\nall told, to clean the whole of the black borders in all three lights. Each of\nthe figures had, as the inscription said, ‘a writing on their vestures\nwhich nobody knew’.',
				'“This discovery, of course, made it absolutely certain to my mind that I\nwas on the right track. And, now, what was the inscription? While I was\ncleaning the glass I almost took pains not to read the lettering, saving up the\ntreat until I had got the whole thing clear. And when that was done, my dear\nGregory, I assure you I could almost have cried from sheer disappointment. What\nI read was only the most hopeless jumble of letters that was ever shaken up in\na hat. Here it is:',
				'“Blank as I felt and must have looked for the first few minutes, my\ndisappointment didn’t last long. I realized almost at once that I was\ndealing with a cipher or cryptogram; and I reflected that it was likely to be\nof a pretty simple kind, considering its early date. So I copied the letters\nwith the most anxious care. Another little point, I may tell you, turned up in\nthe process which confirmed my belief in the cipher. After copying the letters\non Job’s robe I counted them, to make sure that I had them right. There\nwere thirty-eight; and, just as I finished going through them, my eye fell on a\nscratching made with a sharp point on the edge of the border. It was simply the\nnumber xxxviii in Roman numerals. To cut the matter short, there was a similar\nnote, as I may call it, in each of the other lights; and that made it plain to\nme that the glass-painter had had very strict orders from Abbot Thomas about\nthe inscription, and had taken pains to get it correct.',
				'“Well, after that discovery you may imagine how minutely I went over the\nwhole surface of the glass in search of further light. Of course, I did not\nneglect the inscription on the scroll of Zechariah—‘Upon one stone\nare seven eyes,’ but I very quickly concluded that this must refer to\nsome mark on a stone which could only be found in situ, where the\ntreasure was concealed. To be short, I made all possible notes and sketches and\ntracings, and then came back to Parsbury to work out the cipher at leisure. Oh,\nthe agonies I went through! I thought myself very clever at first, for I made\nsure that the key would be found in some of the old books on secret writing.\nThe Steganographia of Joachim Trithemius, who was an earlier\ncontemporary of Abbot Thomas, seemed particularly promising; so I got that and\nSelenius’s Cryptographia and Bacon’s de Augmentis\nScientiarum and some more. But I could hit upon nothing. Then I tried the\nprinciple of the ‘most frequent letter’, taking first Latin and\nthen German as a basis. That didn’t help, either; whether it ought to\nhave done so, I am not clear. And then I came back to the window itself, and\nread over my notes, hoping almost against hope that the Abbot might himself\nhave somewhere supplied the key I wanted. I could make nothing out of the\ncolour or pattern of the robes. There were no landscape backgrounds with\nsubsidiary objects; there was nothing in the canopies. The only resource\npossible seemed to be in the attitudes of the figures. ‘Job,’ I\nread: ‘scroll in left hand, forefinger of right hand extended upwards.\nJohn: holds inscribed book in left hand; with right hand blesses, with two\nfingers. Zechariah: scroll in left hand; right hand extended upwards, as Job,\nbut with three fingers pointing up.’ In other words, I reflected, Job has\none finger extended, John has two, Zechariah has three.\nMay not there be a numeral key concealed in that? My dear Gregory,” said\nMr Somerton, laying his hand on his friend’s knee, “that was\nthe key. I didn’t get it to fit at first, but after two or three trials I\nsaw what was meant. After the first letter of the inscription you skip\none letter, after the next you skip two, and after that skip\nthree. Now look at the result I got. I’ve underlined the letters\nwhich form words:',

				'“Do you see it? ‘Decem millia auri reposita sunt in puteo in\nat. . .’ (Ten thousand [pieces] of gold are laid up in a well in …),\nfollowed by an incomplete word beginning at. So far so good. I tried the\nsame plan with the remaining letters; but it wouldn’t work, and I fancied\nthat perhaps the placing of dots after the three last letters might indicate\nsome difference of procedure. Then I thought to myself, ‘Wasn’t\nthere some allusion to a well in the account of Abbot Thomas in that book the\n“Sertum”?’ Yes, there was: he built a puteus in\natrio (a well in the court). There, of course, was my word atrio.\nThe next step was to copy out the remaining letters of the inscription,\nomitting those I had already used. That gave what you will see on this slip:',

				'“Now, I knew what the three first letters I wanted were—namely,\nrio—to complete the word atrio; and, as you will see, these\nare all to be found in the first five letters. I was a little confused at first\nby the occurrence of two i’s, but very soon I saw that every\nalternate letter must be taken in the remainder of the inscription. You can\nwork it out for yourself; the result, continuing where the first\n‘round’ left off, is this:',
				'‘rio domus abbatialis de Steinfeld a me, Thoma, qui posui custodem super ea.\nGare à qui la touche’.',
				'“So the whole secret was out:',
				'‘Ten thousand pieces of gold are laid up in the well in the court of the\nAbbot’s house of Steinfeld by me, Thomas, who have set a guardian over\nthem. Gare à qui la touche.’',
				'“The last words, I ought to say, are a device which Abbot Thomas had\nadopted. I found it with his arms in another piece of glass at Lord\nD——’s, and he drafted it bodily into his cipher, though it\ndoesn’t quite fit in point of grammar.',
				'“Well, what would any human being have been tempted to do, my dear\nGregory, in my place? Could he have helped setting off, as I did, to Steinfeld,\nand tracing the secret literally to the fountain-head? I don’t believe he\ncould. Anyhow, I couldn’t, and, as I needn’t tell you, I found\nmyself at Steinfeld as soon as the resources of civilization could put me\nthere, and installed myself in the inn you saw. I must tell you that I was not\naltogether free from forebodings—on one hand of disappointment, on the\nother of danger. There was always the possibility that Abbot Thomas’s\nwell might have been wholly obliterated, or else that someone, ignorant of\ncryptograms, and guided only by luck, might have stumbled on the treasure\nbefore me. And then”—there was a very perceptible shaking of the\nvoice here—’I was not entirely easy, I need not mind confessing, as\nto the meaning of the words about the guardian of the treasure. But, if you\ndon’t mind, I’ll say no more about that until—until it\nbecomes necessary.',
				'“At the first possible opportunity Brown and I began exploring the place.\nI had naturally represented myself as being interested in the remains of the\nabbey, and we could not avoid paying a visit to the church, impatient as I was\nto be elsewhere. Still, it did interest me to see the windows where the glass\nhad been, and especially that at the east end of the south aisle. In the\ntracery lights of that I was startled to see some fragments and coats-of-arms\nremaining—Abbot Thomas’s shield was there, and a small figure with\na scroll inscribed Oculos habent, et non videbunt (They have eyes, and\nshall not see), which, I take it, was a hit of the Abbot at his Canons.',
				'“But, of course, the principal object was to find the Abbot’s\nhouse. There is no prescribed place for this, so far as I know, in the plan of\na monastery; you can’t predict of it, as you can of the chapter-house,\nthat it will be on the eastern side of the cloister, or, as of the dormitory,\nthat it will communicate with a transept of the church. I felt that if I asked\nmany questions I might awaken lingering memories of the treasure, and I thought\nit best to try first to discover it for myself. It was not a very long or\ndifficult search. That three-sided court south-east of the church, with\ndeserted piles of building round it, and grass-grown pavement, which you saw\nthis morning, was the place. And glad enough I was to see that it was put to no\nuse, and was neither very far from our inn nor overlooked by any inhabited\nbuilding; there were only orchards and paddocks on the slopes east of the\nchurch. I can tell you that fine stone glowed wonderfully in the rather watery\nyellow sunset that we had on the Tuesday afternoon.',
				'“Next, what about the well? There was not much doubt about that, as you\ncan testify. It is really a very remarkable thing. That curb is, I think, of\nItalian marble, and the carving I thought must be Italian also. There were\nreliefs, you will perhaps remember, of Eliezer and Rebekah, and of Jacob\nopening the well for Rachel, and similar subjects; but, by way of disarming\nsuspicion, I suppose, the Abbot had carefully abstained from any of his cynical\nand allusive inscriptions.',
				'“I examined the whole structure with the keenest interest, of\ncourse—a square well-head with an opening in one side; an arch over it,\nwith a wheel for the rope to pass over, evidently in very good condition still,\nfor it had been used within sixty years, or perhaps even later, though not\nquite recently. Then there was the question of depth and access to the\ninterior. I suppose the depth was about sixty to seventy feet; and as to the\nother point, it really seemed as if the Abbot had wished to lead searchers up\nto the very door of his treasure-house, for, as you tested for yourself, there\nwere big blocks of stone bonded into the masonry, and leading down in a regular\nstaircase round and round the inside of the well.',
				'“It seemed almost too good to be true. I wondered if there was a\ntrap—if the stones were so contrived as to tip over when a weight was\nplaced on them; but I tried a good many with my own weight and with my stick,\nand all seemed, and actually were, perfectly firm. Of course, I resolved that\nBrown and I would make an experiment that very night.',
				'“I was well prepared. Knowing the sort of place I should have to explore,\nI had brought a sufficiency of good rope and bands of webbing to surround my\nbody, and cross-bars to hold to, as well as lanterns and candles and crowbars,\nall of which would go into a single carpet-bag and excite no suspicion. I\nsatisfied myself that my rope would be long enough, and that the wheel for the\nbucket was in good working order, and then we went home to dinner.',
				'“I had a little cautious conversation with the landlord, and made out\nthat he would not be overmuch surprised if I went out for a stroll with my man\nabout nine o’clock, to make (Heaven forgive me!) a sketch of the abbey by\nmoonlight. I asked no questions about the well, and am not likely to do so now.\nI fancy I know as much about it as anyone in Steinfeld: at\nleast”—with a strong shudder—“I don’t want to\nknow any more.',
				'“Now we come to the crisis, and, though I hate to think of it, I feel\nsure, Gregory, that it will be better for me in all ways to recall it just as\nit happened. We started, Brown and I, at about nine with our bag, and attracted\nno attention; for we managed to slip out at the hinder end of the inn-yard into\nan alley which brought us quite to the edge of the village. In five minutes we\nwere at the well, and for some little time we sat on the edge of the well-head\nto make sure that no one was stirring or spying on us. All we heard was some\nhorses cropping grass out of sight farther down the eastern slope. We were\nperfectly unobserved, and had plenty of light from the gorgeous full moon to\nallow us to get the rope properly fitted over the wheel. Then I secured the\nband round my body beneath the arms. We attached the end of the rope very\nsecurely to a ring in the stonework. Brown took the lighted lantern and\nfollowed me; I had a crowbar. And so we began to descend cautiously, feeling\nevery step before we set foot on it, and scanning the walls in search of any\nmarked stone.',
				'“Half aloud I counted the steps as we went down, and we got as far as the\nthirty-eighth before I noted anything at all irregular in the surface of the\nmasonry. Even here there was no mark, and I began to feel very blank, and to\nwonder if the Abbot’s cryptogram could possibly be an elaborate hoax. At\nthe forty-ninth step the staircase ceased. It was with a very sinking heart\nthat I began retracing my steps, and when I was back on the\nthirty-eighth—Brown, with the lantern, being a step or two above\nme—I scrutinized the little bit of irregularity in the stonework with all\nmy might; but there was no vestige of a mark.',
				'“Then it struck me that the texture of the surface looked just a little\nsmoother than the rest, or, at least, in some way different. It might possibly\nbe cement and not stone. I gave it a good blow with my iron bar. There was a\ndecidedly hollow sound, though that might be the result of our being in a well.\nBut there was more. A great flake of cement dropped on to my feet, and I saw\nmarks on the stone underneath. I had tracked the Abbot down, my dear Gregory;\neven now I think of it with a certain pride. It took but a very few more taps\nto clear the whole of the cement away, and I saw a slab of stone about two feet\nsquare, upon which was engraven a cross. Disappointment again, but only for a\nmoment. It was you, Brown, who reassured me by a casual remark. You said, if I\nremember right:',
				'“‘It’s a funny cross: looks like a lot of eyes.’',
				'“I snatched the lantern out of your hand, and saw with inexpressible\npleasure that the cross was composed of seven eyes, four in a vertical\nline, three horizontal. The last of the scrolls in the window was explained in\nthe way I had anticipated. Here was my ‘stone with the seven eyes’.\nSo far the Abbot’s data had been exact, and, as I thought of this, the\nanxiety about the ‘guardian’ returned upon me with increased force.\nStill, I wasn’t going to retreat now.',
				'“Without giving myself time to think, I knocked away the cement all round\nthe marked stone, and then gave it a prise on the right side with my crowbar.\nIt moved at once, and I saw that it was but a thin light slab, such as I could\neasily lift out myself, and that it stopped the entrance to a cavity. I did\nlift it out unbroken, and set it on the step, for it might be very important to\nus to be able to replace it. Then I waited for several minutes on the step just\nabove. I don’t know why, but I think to see if any dreadful thing would\nrush out. Nothing happened. Next I lit a candle, and very cautiously I placed\nit inside the cavity, with some idea of seeing whether there were foul air, and\nof getting a glimpse of what was inside. There was some foulness of air\nwhich nearly extinguished the flame, but in no long time it burned quite\nsteadily. The hole went some little way back, and also on the right and left of\nthe entrance, and I could see some rounded light-coloured objects within which\nmight be bags. There was no use in waiting. I faced the cavity, and looked in.\nThere was nothing immediately in the front of the hole. I put my arm in and\nfelt to the right, very gingerly….',
				'“Just give me a glass of cognac, Brown. I’ll go on in a moment,\nGregory….',
				'“Well, I felt to the right, and my fingers touched something curved, that\nfelt—yes—more or less like leather; dampish it was, and evidently\npart of a heavy, full thing. There was nothing, I must say, to alarm one. I\ngrew bolder, and putting both hands in as well as I could, I pulled it to me,\nand it came. It was heavy, but moved more easily than I had expected. As I\npulled it towards the entrance, my left elbow knocked over and extinguished the\ncandle. I got the thing fairly in front of the mouth and began drawing it out.\nJust then Brown gave a sharp ejaculation and ran quickly up the steps with the\nlantern. He will tell you why in a moment. Startled as I was, I looked round\nafter him, and saw him stand for a minute at the top and then walk away a few\nyards. Then I heard him call softly, ‘All right, sir,’ and went on\npulling out the great bag, in complete darkness. It hung for an instant on the\nedge of the hole, then slipped forward on to my chest, and put its arms\nround my neck.',
				'“My dear Gregory, I am telling you the exact truth. I believe I am now\nacquainted with the extremity of terror and repulsion which a man can endure\nwithout losing his mind. I can only just manage to tell you now the bare\noutline of the experience. I was conscious of a most horrible smell of mould,\nand of a cold kind of face pressed against my own, and moving slowly over it,\nand of several—I don’t know how many—legs or arms or\ntentacles or something clinging to my body. I screamed out, Brown says, like a\nbeast, and fell away backward from the step on which I stood, and the creature\nslipped downwards, I suppose, on to that same step. Providentially the band\nround me held firm. Brown did not lose his head, and was strong enough to pull\nme up to the top and get me over the edge quite promptly. How he managed it\nexactly I don’t know, and I think he would find it hard to tell you. I\nbelieve he contrived to hide our implements in the deserted building near by,\nand with very great difficulty he got me back to the inn. I was in no state to\nmake explanations, and Brown knows no German; but next morning I told the\npeople some tale of having had a bad fall in the abbey ruins, which, I suppose,\nthey believed. And now, before I go further, I should just like you to hear\nwhat Brown’s experiences during those few minutes were. Tell the Rector,\nBrown, what you told me.”',
				'“Well, sir,” said Brown, speaking low and nervously, “it was\njust this way. Master was busy down in front of the ’ole, and I was\n’olding the lantern and looking on, when I ’eard somethink drop in\nthe water from the top, as I thought. So I looked up, and I see someone’s\n’ead lookin’ over at us. I s’pose I must ha’ said\nsomethink, and I ’eld the light up and run up the steps, and my light\nshone right on the face. That was a bad un, sir, if ever I see one! A holdish\nman, and the face very much fell in, and larfin’, as I thought. And I got\nup the steps as quick pretty nigh as I’m tellin’ you, and when I\nwas out on the ground there warn’t a sign of any person. There\n’adn’t been the time for anyone to get away, let alone a hold chap,\nand I made sure he warn’t crouching down by the well, nor nothink. Next\nthing I hear master cry out somethink ’orrible, and hall I see was him\nhanging out by the rope, and, as master says, ’owever I got him up I\ncouldn’t tell you.”',
				'“You hear that, Gregory?” said Mr Somerton. “Now, does any\nexplanation of that incident strike you?”',
				'“The whole thing is so ghastly and abnormal that I must own it puts me\nquite off my balance; but the thought did occur to me that possibly\nthe—well, the person who set the trap might have come to see the success\nof his plan.”',
				'“Just so, Gregory, just so. I can think of nothing else\nso—likely, I should say, if such a word had a place anywhere in my\nstory. I think it must have been the Abbot…. Well, I haven’t much more to\ntell you. I spent a miserable night, Brown sitting up with me. Next day I was\nno better; unable to get up; no doctor to be had; and, if one had been\navailable, I doubt if he could have done much for me. I made Brown write off to\nyou, and spent a second terrible night. And, Gregory, of this I am sure, and I\nthink it affected me more than the first shock, for it lasted longer: there was\nsomeone or something on the watch outside my door the whole night. I almost\nfancy there were two. It wasn’t only the faint noises I heard from time\nto time all through the dark hours, but there was the smell—the hideous\nsmell of mould. Every rag I had had on me on that first evening I had stripped\noff and made Brown take it away. I believe he stuffed the things into the stove\nin his room; and yet the smell was there, as intense as it had been in the\nwell; and, what is more, it came from outside the door. But with the first\nglimmer of dawn it faded out, and the sounds ceased, too; and that convinced me\nthat the thing or things were creatures of darkness, and could not stand the\ndaylight; and so I was sure that if anyone could put back the stone, it or they\nwould be powerless until someone else took it away again. I had to wait until\nyou came to get that done. Of course, I couldn’t send Brown to do it by\nhimself, and still less could I tell anyone who belonged to the place.',
				'“Well, there is my story; and, if you don’t believe it, I\ncan’t help it. But I think you do.”',
				'“Indeed,” said Mr Gregory, “I can find no alternative. I\nmust believe it! I saw the well and the stone myself, and had a glimpse,\nI thought, of the bags or something else in the hole. And, to be plain with\nyou, Somerton, I believe my door was watched last night, too.”',
				'“I dare say it was, Gregory; but, thank goodness, that is over. Have you,\nby the way, anything to tell about your visit to that dreadful place?”',
				'“Very little,” was the answer. “Brown and I managed easily\nenough to get the slab into its place, and he fixed it very firmly with the\nirons and wedges you had desired him to get, and we contrived to smear the\nsurface with mud so that it looks just like the rest of the wall. One thing I\ndid notice in the carving on the well-head, which I think must have escaped\nyou. It was a horrid, grotesque shape—perhaps more like a toad than\nanything else, and there was a label by it inscribed with the two words,\n‘Depositum custodi’.”[9]',
				'[9]\n“Keep that which is committed to thee.”',
